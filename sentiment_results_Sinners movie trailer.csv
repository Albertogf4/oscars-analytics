It is very ridiculous.  Nowadays Oscar committee is a joke for me.  It is all politically-related.  Movies from South Korea, Taiwan, Japan always nominated.  In my point of view, most of movies from Hollywood for more than 2 decades were poorly made in opposite to its huge budget.  If you are a huge movie-goer, I dare all of you to see Chinese movie called Hero (2002) starring Jet Li, Tony Leung, Donni Yen, Maggie Cheung and directed by Yimou Zhang  This movie has been the BEST movie of all time for me.  The BEST movie ever made so far.  It is so DAWN good.  If you know how the movie is all about.  Hey, don't get me wrong.  I am not Chinese.",0.017,0.8,0.183,0.9788,Positive

I went to see it due to very positive unusual reviews about the music. But the whole movie, script using history, directors, producers, actors, photography and all behind the scenes support, shows its a labor of love making a great movie. Hope it gets rereleased in a Dolby (special speakers for surround sound), even better would be Dolby IMAX. And yes the dance concert scene showing the brief history of humans with music should be part of every school's music curriculum.",0.0,0.686,0.314,0.9909,Positive

The one thing I found frustrating was the music.  Now, I don't know if it was like this at the theatres, but on Prime, it seemed very muffled and unorganized. The scenes were loosely connected, and the back stories didn't really do much for the narrative. I like Michael B Jordan, but this wasn't his best effort. The story of vampires is a subject that's difficult to tie to the early 1920s time period. His attempt was a valiant effort indeed. I give it 2 1/2 out of 5. It's still a good movie to lose yourself in, if only for 125 minutes.",0.1,0.794,0.107,-0.2621,Negative

Why did they seem to want to downplay it like they did? Especially from a director who has several hugely successful movies on his resume. That doesn't happen with other directors. It didn't happen with Once Upon a time in Hollywood, which had the same exact budget this movie did. They called that movie a success right outta the gate. Curious.",0.016,0.803,0.181,0.9737,Positive

We just left the theater, and my boyfriend and I couldn’t stop talking about the “dancing through time” scene—it completely blew us away. It was more than just beautiful choreography; it was a powerful visual journey through Black history and culture. From traditional African rhythms to modern-day movements like hip-hop and twerking, every step told a story of resilience, evolution, and identity.

It captured the spirit of generations in just a few minutes, and I honestly haven’t stopped thinking about it. That scene alone makes the entire film unforgettable.",0.058,0.803,0.139,0.8641,Positive
