I don't have anything to say which meant it worked in its own right...except when it started to lag. The last hour needed an edit to keep the whole thing snappy like the start. A little dark, but their personal strength and vision were united. I really enjoyed some of these characters, even deCaprio, and I never like deCaprio. The 'regular' kids were awesome in their clips. The film could have had more of that, how the 3rd parties reacted. In film the best moments are others' reactions, like when the dolphins breached in the Big Blue. The high school kids' non-acting acting was a thing of beauty. Juxtaposing that with Sean Penn's gross character which was just over the top weird. I'm not saying that the state actors aren't degenerates, but that sociopathic narcissism is also a blind spot, not a Bond supervillain.",0.071,0.714,0.214,0.9871,Positive,0,1,0,1,1,1,0

One Battle After Another trailer,One Battle After Another  - Official Trailer - Warner Bros. UK &amp; Ireland,youtube,"One Battle After Another is nothing more than a bloated piece of liberal propaganda masquerading as high art, pushing a dangerous narrative that romanticizes left-wing violence and portrays conservatives as cartoonish fascist villains. Paul Thomas Anderson crafts a fever dream where washed-up radicals bombing buildings and resisting immigration enforcement are depicted as sympathetic underdogs fighting a white supremacist dystopia, ignoring the real-world consequences of such extremism. With Leonardo DiCaprio's sweaty, incompetent protagonist shouting revolutionary slogans while enabling chaos, the film feels like an apologia for Antifa-style terrorism, especially ill-timed amid recent political violence—it's irresponsible and could inspire more division rather than entertain. Skip this three-hour preach fest; it's not satire, it's insidious Hollywood bias at its worst, glorifying losers who waste lives on misguided ""resistance"" instead of productive citizenship. 0/10—save your money for films that don't hate half the country.",0.268,0.604,0.129,-0.9808,Negative,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

Soooooooo, I remember the time we had the equipment and moved it and it was stable and we held it at location and it worked correctly but I forgot what we were supposed to be doing. But they know how to repair after seeing us work on the matter a few time. 

Then that location was stable and really nice. Ok, so then I get abducted from there. And i was  happy. 


So I want to remind the time when I was going to go to full time academy in elementary school and dad said its a nice place and mom was like I can't live without her here so I had to leave there and it was wonderful. Then different people showed up and it was safe but weird and creepy very up to something kids there and no one else. We've done this a few times and I think we went on a field trip and then I recall being at home on the other side of the country, then back at the full time academy by like black van. Im not kidding. Normal was sooooo close. 


I see a lot of dynamics of Hebrew status and isreali status of the people in the movie. I also see dynamics where we split up matters that seem to be a matter in a reasonably seceret way to keep things stable.",0.041,0.792,0.167,0.9871,Positive,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

I’ve seen the movie  3 times in 70mm IMAX and am going again in 2 days for the re- release. The highway chase at the end is worth the price of admission alone. The cinematography – the action choreography and the music make it an incredible IMAX experience.  this trailer reminds me of how incredible, funny, shocking and inventive the dialogue in the script is as well. Hopefully only those of us who have seen the movie will see this  because we think of spoilers as plot points, but this trailer does spoil a lot of the best dialogue moments.",0.028,0.821,0.151,0.9254,Positive,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

F1 movie trailer,F1® The Movie | Main Trailer,youtube,"When I first saw the advertisements for the F1 movie I knew I had to watch it. I personally am not too into the sport, but the immersive visuals hooked me. At the start, you are introduced to Sonny Hayes, a man whose career almost ended in a brutal crash. Throughout the entire movie, this crash seems to be haunting him, even being the reason as to why he left the sport in the first place. He’s portrayed by Brad Pitt, who I know mostly for his roles as David Mills on Se7en and Tyler Durden on Fight Club. A couple months before I saw the F1 movie, I saw Se7en so I already had high expectations for the F1 movie. Anyway, he goes on to win the 24 Hours of Daytona and meets with his former teammate and close friend, Ruben Cervantes. His friend recruits him into his currently failing team known as APXGP, where he meets Joshua Pearce, a young rising star in the F1 scene. Pearce is played by Damson Idris, a person widely known for their role as Franklin Saint on Snowfall. Throughout the entire story, these two are our main characters. 
	Sonny Hayes' whole role in the entire movie is to be a mentor for Pearce. And that’s exactly what he does. One thing that I loved about Sonny was his calmness compared to Joshua. While Joshua is kind of like a hot head, Hayes keeps his cool in almost every situation. They are essentially the opposites of each other. Also, the evolution of their relationship is something that I thought was great. They begin with having a sort of rivalry and high egos; though, most of this is just Joshua. Thus, as the story progresses more, Joshua starts to kind of understand Hayes and they both create a mutual respect for each other and think of the team first rather than their own selves. In the end, one of the main points of the movie is their bond and how it grows.
	Moving on from the characters, the movie’s visuals are stunning. The movie shows the competitiveness within F1 and helps viewers understand what truly happens on the track. One thing I was surprised to find out about this was that some scenes were actually shot during the Grand-Prix’s. Also, the movie shows realistic racing, but this was something I expected since Lewis Hamilton was one of the producers of the movie. In my opinion, this is something that fits both casual movie watchers, and fans of F1. 
In conclusion, I think this is something that is worth watching. The characters are great, and so are the visuals. I can’t say much except to just tell you to watch it. It’s a great movie which can leave you with an interest in F1. There are many great things about this movie that I didn’t mention like the importance of Haye’s deck of cards. It’s a movie that will have you wondering about the next adventure of Hayes.",0.043,0.801,0.156,0.997,Positive,1,1,0,0,1,0,0

F1 movie trailer,F1® The Movie | Main Trailer,youtube,"Not being a particular Formula 1 fan, I didn't focus on the aesthetic boldness of director Joseph Kosinski. So I set aside any comparisons with the harsh realities of this world.
And I'm glad I did, because I loved this blockbuster. Admittedly, the storyline is somewhat farcical, with the sixty-year-old man called in to save a team in total decline. It's a bit like Jackie Stewart, having become a team manager, calling Jacky Ickx back in 2000 to do battle with Schumacher and Häkkinen.
But it's cinema, so it doesn't matter, right? Especially since the racing scenes are impressive. I didn't notice the time passing, and the film still lasts 2 hours and 35 minutes. And then there's the music by Hans Zimmer, of course.
I honestly had a good laugh. Javier Bardem is exquisite as usual, Damson Idris has a beautiful smile, little Kerry Condon is delicious as can be and Brad Pitt is still as cool as ever... ""Who said anything about safe ?"" 😉",0.025,0.721,0.254,0.9937,Positive,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

_As an F1 movie, seen from a diehard fan, its a complete mess._ It ignores a lot of the rules and regulations of the sport.

_But as a movie produced by Lewis Hamilton himself, targeted to general audiences, _*_ITS GREAT._*

It ignores the rulebook for the sake of action, it has great shots, a really flawless teamwork to make the races as intense as they can be, and the fact that the real F1 presenters are involved, makes a better inmersion overall.

No!  The lead character is human trash.  He's an immoral manipulator that cons people NONSTOP to get what he wants.  If you're interested in watching this for some kind of inspiration, in a Rocky type way, this isn't the film for you.  Is it technically good  with excellent acting/directing and entertaining soundtrack, yes.  

Because I was expecting a more typicall ""inspirational"" film, i was shocked that this isn't that.  I personally don't want to spend 2 hours watching an immoral hustler overcoming non stop nightmare type scenarios that he puts himself in due to his dumb choices.  I guess one redeeming quality of the film is that, in the script, the lead character has non stop problems and in the end, his outcome is far from ideal, so they don't glamorize deception.",0.127,0.691,0.182,0.9145,Positive,0,1,1,1,0,0,1

That was one HELL of a story.  Kudos to the script writing team.     Direction was nothing short of BRILLIANT.!!!
Casting was pure perfection..!     Having   KOTO KAWAGUCHI   in this film gave it credibility and authenticity..!
And genius to have Kevin O'Leary playing Rockwell.  Would love to know the cheque he wrote to production-
but this is how much of Hollywood works.     BUT.....  he came through with flying colours..!!!   He was ''wonderful'' 😂
The lead actor T.C will be nominated and win his first Oscar because he blew away the competition.    Everything about his character was pure  perfection;  his walk, his talk, his swagg, his arrogance, & his insane rebellious manic ambition.",0.109,0.694,0.198,0.9472,Positive,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Yes he is an a- h0le however it reflects reality - the go better ruthless attitude of many at the top ... Whilst he isn't a good person and possesses the worst moral traits, his ambition and confidence is inspirational .. believing in yourself that much that you won't take nothing but success ... I read on another review that the chaotic chain of events gave some people anxiety ... Welcome to my life lol. Didn't give me anxiety at all .. just felt like everyday to me, where things can go wrong and not everything is always in your control ... But life goes on. I guess you could say that the movie is about determination. Also a harsh reminder that yes sometimes bad people in life do make it in life ... But what do you chose .. I rather sleep at night than chose wrong over right. Take from it what you will. But honestly I think it was a good movie and I was kept fully engaged without getting bored.

Marty Supreme movie trailer,Marty Supreme | Official Teaser HD | A24,youtube,"This movie felt really sexist to me. The female characters aren’t written as full people, they’re basically there to be desired, used, or to push the male lead’s story forward. Everything about them is framed through a male gaze, like they’re pawns or prizes rather than subjects with agency.

What bothered me most is that the film doesn’t even question this dynamic. It just repeats the same tired, male-dominated storytelling and acts like that’s edgy or meaningful. Even pregnancy is handled in a weirdly objectifying way, turning the female body into another aesthetic or narrative device instead of something human or complex.

It’s not challenging film conventions at all, it’s reinforcing them. For a movie that seems to think it’s saying something bold, it actually feels pretty shallow and outdated.",0.06,0.797,0.143,0.9073,Positive,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

Marty Supreme movie trailer,Marty Supreme | Official Teaser HD | A24,youtube,"Lolzz I saw people saying Chalamet was channeling energy of a Dog Day Afternoon Pacino, or a young De Niro. Nothing, literally nothing within this trailer did Chalamet give off anything close to the intensity or charisma of those twos early works. Chalamet is one of those actors that I feel like Mugatu every time he is brought up. Like he’s not bad, but he’s not great. People act like he’s fucking amazing and top notch though. And I feel like I’m losing my mind. I think people just want him to be more than he actually is. We have such a lack truly truly talented young performers now that people just fabricate this shit, well that and the PR teams do a fine job at selling you that. I mean maybe he’ll prove me wrong and he’ll be what people said in this movie, but I highly doubt it. I hear shit like that with every Chalamet performance, and yet, it’s always mid lol",0.135,0.65,0.216,0.9136,Positive,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Marty Supreme movie trailer,Marty Supreme | Official Promo HD | A24,youtube,"This movie felt really sexist to me. The female characters aren’t written as full people, they’re basically there to be desired, used, or to push the male lead’s story forward. Everything about them is framed through a male gaze, like they’re pawns or prizes rather than subjects with agency.

What bothered me most is that the film doesn’t even question this dynamic. It just repeats the same tired, male-dominated storytelling and acts like that’s edgy or meaningful. Even pregnancy is handled in a weirdly objectifying way, turning the female body into another aesthetic or narrative device instead of something human or complex.

It’s not challenging film conventions at all, it’s reinforcing them. For a movie that seems to think it’s saying something bold, it actually feels pretty shallow and outdated.",0.06,0.797,0.143,0.9073,Positive,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

A little dark, but their personal strength and vision were united. I really enjoyed some of these characters, even deCaprio, and I never like deCaprio. The 'regular' kids were awesome in their clips. The film could have had more of that, how the 3rd parties reacted. In film the best moments are others' reactions, like when the dolphins breached in the Big Blue. The high school kids' non-acting acting was a thing of beauty. Juxtaposing that with Sean Penn's gross character which was just over the top weird.

Paul Thomas Anderson crafts a fever dream where washed-up radicals bombing buildings and resisting immigration enforcement are depicted as sympathetic underdogs fighting a white supremacist dystopia, ignoring the real-world consequences of such extremism. With Leonardo DiCaprio's sweaty, incompetent protagonist shouting revolutionary slogans while enabling chaos, the film feels like an apologia for Antifa-style terrorism, especially ill-timed amid recent political violence—it's irresponsible and could inspire more division rather than entertain.

It really is pathetic how toxic and partisan the American political landscape has become, it's childish really. Obviously I don't expect everyone to love the same movies as me, some films won't land with people. But there are just way too many one star reviews of this film on there for it to be a coincidence.

The supporting cast is a little underdeveloped and some subplots in the movie is like a cutscene you can’t skip but Del Toro, Penn and Dicaprio are outstanding.

Soooooooo, I remember the time we had the equipment and moved it and it was stable and we held it at location and it worked correctly but I forgot what we were supposed to be doing. But they know how to repair after seeing us work on the matter a few time. 

Then that location was stable and really nice. Ok, so then I get abducted from there. And i was  happy. 


So I want to remind the time when I was going to go to full time academy in elementary school and dad said its a nice place and mom was like I can't live without her here so I had to leave there and it was wonderful. Then different people showed up and it was safe but weird and creepy very up to something kids there and no one else. We've done this a few times and I think we went on a field trip and then I recall being at home on the other side of the country, then back at the full time academy by like black van. Im not kidding. Normal was sooooo close. 


I see a lot of dynamics of Hebrew status and isreali status of the people in the movie. I also see dynamics where we split up matters that seem to be a matter in a reasonably seceret way to keep things stable.",0.041,0.792,0.167,0.9871,Positive,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

I’ve seen the movie  3 times in 70mm IMAX and am going again in 2 days for the re- release. The highway chase at the end is worth the price of admission alone. The cinematography – the action choreography and the music make it an incredible IMAX experience.  this trailer reminds me of how incredible, funny, shocking and inventive the dialogue in the script is as well. Hopefully only those of us who have seen the movie will see this  because we think of spoilers as plot points, but this trailer does spoil a lot of the best dialogue moments.",0.028,0.821,0.151,0.9254,Positive,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

Nowadays Oscar committee is a joke for me.  It is all politically-related.  Movies from South Korea, Taiwan, Japan always nominated.  In my point of view, most of movies from Hollywood for more than 2 decades were poorly made in opposite to its huge budget.  If you are a huge movie-goer, I dare all of you to see Chinese movie called Hero (2002) starring Jet Li, Tony Leung, Donni Yen, Maggie Cheung and directed by Yimou Zhang  This movie has been the BEST movie of all time for me.  The BEST movie ever made so far.  It is so DAWN good.  If you know how the movie is all about.  Hey, don't get me wrong.  I am not Chinese.",0.017,0.8,0.183,0.9788,Positive,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now, I don't know if it was like this at the theatres, but on Prime, it seemed very muffled and unorganized. The scenes were loosely connected, and the back stories didn't really do much for the narrative. I like Michael B Jordan, but this wasn't his best effort. The story of vampires is a subject that's difficult to tie to the early 1920s time period. His attempt was a valiant effort indeed. I give it 2 1/2 out of 5.

   Of this film, I thought, I was watching, a docu-drama about, Black Coulture.
     As my mom and dad, grew up in North Carolina,  during the 1930s;
Then, I loved that this  brought together, the Asain element and didn't sugar-coat, one aspect. 
Beautifully written, ( I stated that I thought this was a docu-drama );
Well acted, with wonderful cinematography and direction.
     And I was scared shitless.

Why did they seem to want to downplay it like they did? Especially from a director who has several hugely successful movies on his resume. That doesn't happen with other directors. It didn't happen with Once Upon a time in Hollywood, which had the same exact budget this movie did. They called that movie a success right outta the gate.

Up front it's just incredibly well paced. Like OP said it just flies by somehow. But there's so much attention to detail. There's so many small insignificant things that are given no highlights that come in later. I definitely think there's a strong argument for watching it twice because there's a lot of stuff with Bob at the start of the movie pre-kid that seems like dressing and knowing how he ends up and what he has to deal with makes it more interesting. And the performances are really good. Sean Penn is so goddamn weird but still grounded in a way that feels vaguely like I've met that kind of guy before. Leo being a struggling fuck up who's energy is at a 10 almost the whole movie is super entertaining. And in particular the whole segment where hes with Del Toro is amazing for what is happening as a whole. There is so much to take in between what Bob's doing, what Del Toro is doing, and what the background is doing. There's some really entertaining coregraphy for that whole portion of the movie.",0.102,0.704,0.194,0.9735,Positive,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

There were tons of walkouts at that one though. Imagine walking out before Rose fucking' Byrne comes on for a Q&amp;A. Couldn't be me.

The movies that had the most walkouts this year:

* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You**
* **[The Chronology of Water](https://i.imgur.com/iRt4Y0a.jpeg)** (i swear at least 150 people walked out of this one)
* **[The Testament of Ann Lee](https://i.imgur.com/HzGkRUj.jpeg)** 

The first two make sense. Those movies are *aggressive*. They actively don't give a shit about your feelings. They want to make you feel like shit. **Ann Lee** makes no sense, nobody should be walking out of that. If you walk out of **Ann Lee** we can't be friends.

F1 movie,I saw 290 movies in theaters in 2025. Here is my full ranking.,reddit,"Here are some reviews/thoughts I had to cut to fit the maximum character count:

* **The Threesome** - 8/10 - Really really really great stuff. Smart, funny, heartfelt. It could be a really cheesy setup (threesome goes horribly wrong), but it takes lots of turns you don't expect and it's super smartly written and excellently acted (especially Zoey Deutsch). Sweet little comfort movie. Dope soundtrack too.	

* **Final Destination: Bloodlines** 8/10 - I've always had a soft-spot for the original, but the other movies didn't do much for me and I even skipped some. Was originally going to skip this one but really glad I didn't. A new high-point for the series. Kind of everything I want in a horror. Funny, surprisingly, nasty/hilarious kills. It subverts your expectations at every corner and has one of the best mic-drop endings of the year. Give me more

* **Bring Her Back** - 8/10  Jesus christ. Really great horror film, and apart from one very weird/jarring/out-of-place tonal shift near the end (when there's the cleaning montage and the one-liner of the girl playing ball), it's consitent throughout.	

* **Christy** - 7/10 - It’s a boxing biopic with a tragic 2nd act and a happy ending. You’ve seen it a million times, but really solid lead performances from Sydney Sweeney (in her best role yet) and Ben Foster (at his most reviling) and a sweeping, war-movie-like orchestral score keep it engaging throughout. Chad Coleman only has a few minutes of screentime but he makes them memorable as Don King, highlight of the movie for me. In a just world, he’d get Supporting Actor Oscar buzz. 	

* **The Surfer** - 7/10 - Pretty challenging watch and will test a lot of people's patience but it ultimately pays off, even though you're left with a lot of questions (in a good way). Another classic weird-Cage performance that builds up perfectly. Loved all of the extremely-uncomfortable close-ups. You doubt yourself for a lot of the movie which I really enjoyed.	
* **Blue Heron** - 7/10 - Canada's *We Need To Talk About Kevin*. Unfortunately, the subtitles weren't on during my screening so I probably missed some important stuff, but it's an impressive debut film with a complicated-but-well-done timeline.	

* **A Big Beautiful Journey** - 7/10 - Everyone hates it, I liked it. Yes it drags a bit in the middle and some of the 'visiting the past' scenes are weird (50-year old Colin Farrell confessing love to his 15-year old high school crush...?), and I would pay money for the 3-minute Burger King ad in the middle to not exist, but the soundtrack/needle drops were built in a lab specifically for me and there's a lot of sweet moments. It's corny in the best way, filled with goofy lines like ""I prefer to feel nervous with you than nothing alone"", which just kinda worked for me.	

* **The Wizard of the Kremlin** - 7/10 - There's a 9/10 movie in here somewhere with some better editing/pacing. Literally all of the first ~30 minutes can be cut. Jeffrey Wright can be cut, Alicia Vikander can be cut. Concentrate more on Putin and you've got a stew going. Right now, it's a bunch of solid potential and great performances that result in not much of anything. Paul Dano trying to play a teenager for a few scenes was very not good. Good movie, could be a lot better.

* **On Swift Horses** - 7/10 - A bit long and melodramatic but kept you engaged enough (with two intertwined storylines) to keep it interesting. Daisy Edgar Jones is great (+ some steamy lesbian sex scenes for all u sick pervs). Kinda over Jacob Elordi's schtick though. He's played the same character for like 5 movies in a row. He's always just doing a James Dean impression.	

* **Rust** - 7/10 - Went in with rock-bottom expectations but it was surprisingly solid. Very well writen and well shot, with solid performances (especially Travis Fimmel, one of the best supporting performances of the year so far). It's definitely a bit slow and long (most people will get bored), but the dialogue really works and there's a lot of depth to the worldbuilding. Hard to ignore the tragedy during the movie though, the movie starts off with someone accidentally shooting someone and you're just like ""oof"".	

* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You** - 6/10 - Rose Byrne puts in an incredible performance and is supported by a great cast, especially Conan O’Brien and ASAP Rocky) who’s starting to pop up and standout in lots of things recently), but the constant close-ups and confusing drug &amp; alcohol-induced blow-ups keep it from going great. They got a bit repetitive. The smashed-hamster to lasagna sequence was top-tier as far as transitions go though. 	

* **Hard Truths** - 5/10 - Introduces you to possibly the most irritating character ever put on the big screen (and not in a good way like *Naked*), with zero redeeming qualities and no arc, with a frustratingly pointless ending. Very very rough. I know that Mike Leigh won't hold your hand and answer all of the questions, but sheesh, I needed something more. Huge disappointment.

* **Fuze** - 5/10 -  I haven’t seen a third act derailment this bad since *White Noise*. Just a total mess in the last 30 minutes that completely kills a somewhat-decent premise. I don't know if David Mackenzie has another *Hell or High Water* in him.

* **Eastern Western** - 3/10 - If you thought Kevin Costner's *Horizon* was slow, wait until you get a hold of this. The hardest I had to fight to slay asleep all year. Would make for a good white noise machine to fall asleep.	

* **High Rollers** - 3/10 - You'll see a lot of people joke about movies being money laundering schemes, but this could *actually* be one. The director, Randall Emmett, is probably the shadiest dude in Hollywood. He keeps bankrolling John Travolta's straight-to-the-garbage-bin movies somehow. A documentary about how his films are made would undoubetdly be more interesting than this trash.

* **Good American Family** - 3/10 - Garbage streaming true-crime slop. Very messy. It wants to be serious and dark but it's so cartoony and poorly executed. It's filmed like a car commercial. But Mark Duplass is the champion of indie film so I'll always support. He basically admitted (several times) during the Q&amp;A that he basically took this gig to fund his more serious, indie films.",0.104,0.695,0.2,0.9993,Positive,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

The Minecraft movie is on track to make a billion dollars. So, yes, they do. Because people do.

Do you see the problem here? It's the same issue every single time this comes up on r/movies. An original movie has to be good, interesting, and well-advertised, and it has to play in a clean theater, and then *maybe* we'll all go see it (and if its all of those things, and still fails, we'll say it was secretly bad or poorly advertised or whatever).

**IP-driven movies need none of that**. They don't need to be good. The marketing can be cringy--sometimes that just makes people want to watch it more. The movie theater can be people throwing things at the screen. It doesn't matter.

We've basically seen what caused the death of arcades, the home experience has caught up to the theater experience, at least enough to where going to the theater isn't worth it most of the time.  

At the theater, I have to deal with people on their phones, talking, babies, people crunching, etc. I can't pause to take a piss or a refill, the seats, while better, are still weirdly uncomfortable, the audio is sometimes insane and I can't put on subtitles.  

At home, I get a good enough sized screen and the sound quality is good enough.  Is it as a good as a theater? No, but it's also not a 20-30 inch CRT at 240p with 2 tinny speakers.  

Also fuck ads.  Every time I go to the theater before we even get previews we get 5-10 minutes of straight ads after spending $15-30 on a ticket.  Fuck that.

Similar to the console to arcade analogy, you'll never replace a full scale Daytona or After Burner cabinet, but that's a unique experience.

This was big. Something changed in our collective psyche around when the internet became accessible to everyone with smartphones between 2011 and 2015. 


Before then, a lot of the internet felt like stumbling through isolated pockets of people huddled in a sea of dark. A mysterious new frontier where anything was maybe possible, certainly man-made horrors like serial killers, cartel mutilations, and harmful sadomasochism, so why not ghosts and demons, too? Pre-human civilizations, aliens, government spooks, voices in the woods. It felt like telling stories around a campfire.



And just like that, there was a suspension of disbelief, where your sober mind didn't believe these things, of course, but huddled around your monitor at 2am when the wind was blowing, Ted The Caver seemed real. 


The Blair Witch is a similar campfire story. It's not scary in the bright of day. And people's attention spans are shot so it seems slow. But as someone that camped a lot as a kid in woods just like that? Every branch snapping eating at your paranoia.

Denzel reaches the bridge, they are in a Columbia class submarine, the vessel has positive buoyancy and is on the surface. There is a wretched storm outside, and after a moment of clarity the faint light of a rescue beacon is visible.

I always find the example he used to be so weird.  I mean he's talking about how now studios have to make all their money from theaters where they used to have two bites out of the apple with VHS/DVD released but (1) Behind the Candelabra wasn't even really released in theaters as it was an HBO movie and (2) I see absolutely nothing to indicate that the DVD sold especially well.

The fact of the matter is the list of bestselling VHS and DVDs in any given year was always nearly identical to that or the previous year's box office smashes.  Sure, cult classics exist but they're very, very few and very, very, far between. It's not like studios went into Napolean Dynamite knowing it would perform poorly in theaters then become a rental juggernaut among college students for a couple of weeks.  

It also ignores that not only do many of these IP driven films flop (see: The Marvels, The Flash, and latest Indiana Jones film) but studios have chosen to release some straight to streaming (see: BlackWidow) and some are hidden away forever (See: Batgirl).  They're still dropping $200M-$400M on these films that are frequently making nothing in box office venue.

The idea that they just can't take a chance on a non-Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Star Trek (although maybe this series is dead too), James Bond, Fast &amp; Furious, or Disney movie just seems nonsense.",0.119,0.815,0.065,-0.9583,Negative,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

F1 movie,Where does Brad Pitt rank among the true acting greats?,reddit,"Really, really good, borderline great actor. He has range but doesn't disappear into every role, although that's not necessarily needed for every role either. Does great with comedy, can work in any genre, and has given multiple memorable performances in multiple classic and well loved (or at the very least have a cult following) films. 

What really helps Pitt is the projects he chooses and the directors he's worked with. He doesn't have a franchise, so he's never been locked in with a long term character. 

The comparisons to Tom Cruise are valid, but where Cruise has leaned harder into action and more mass appeal films, Pitt has a more diverse mix, especially post 2010.

Edit: I blanked on the Oceans movies. But it kind of proves my point, because if someone asked me to list Pitt movies, they would be way low on the list.",0.016,0.819,0.165,0.9776,Positive,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Yes, there are some things that wouldn't happen (with penalties etc.).

BUT - the depiction of the sport, the weekend, the technical terms (showing things like purple sectors, ERS, DRS, tyre strategy etc.), the way they speak on the radio ""push"", ""box"" (other than ignoring radio is broadcast to the whole grid).  I was smiling like a kid in a candy shop when Max's radio was ""Very Naughty"" to Sonny, and giving him the finger - you just know that's what he would say and do in real life.

2024 started good with Dune 2 which was huge critically and financially, then Godzilla X Kong was a financial hit despite average/mid reviews, then Furiosa is the opposite where has good WOM but is a big money loss, Watchers and Horizon didn’t do well, they had co-distribution on Twisters which was big, then Trap did just fine, like it barely broke even, then Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is also big like Twisters, okay, they are doing better, nope Joker 2 shits the bed completely both ways, then LOTR War of the Rohorrim did very bad for being connected to the IP it was. So in total, in 2024, WB in America distributed 9 and a half (Twisters is half) movies in 2024 that got wide theatrical releases, only 3 and a half of them could be called hits. Technically calling Twisters a hit is also maybe a stretch, it was huge in America but not globally. 

2025, WB America has distributed 7 seven films, they started off rough with Companion which did just fine, Mickey 17 was a bomb, and Alto Knights was a bomb both ways but since Minecraft, it’s been box office hit after box office hit. I wonder how long it’s gonna go for and what film will be the one that breaks the streak. I unfortunately think One Battle After Another will be the one… Superman’s gonna be a success no doubt, Weapons relies on word of mouth/marketing, it’s budget is low enough that 150 million ww would make it a hit. Conjuring 4 depends on the word of mouth also, budget isn’t known yet, One Battle After Another though, may be another Killers of the Flower Moon situation, it’s budget is 140 million….",0.136,0.746,0.119,-0.899,Negative,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Back in 2008 a car crashed on purpose to benefit a teammate on the way to him winning the race. It was a huge scandal. 

A back marker team who has never scored a point doesn’t overnight become competitive in a span of 9 races by shaving a couple tenths off a lap time either. Other teams would follow suit almost immediately if a part was *that* advantageous.

If an F1 driver tried to do what Sonny did in his races, they’d be banned immediately. The man is an F1 terrorist. I really can’t even cover in this comment all the illegal things he did in this movie. 

Intentionally causing a safety car or red flag for strategy purposes is a HUGE no-no. Google Singapore GP 2008 for an example of the mess it causes. 

A new team like APX GP not being able to score points in its first few seasons is completely normal and expected, and expecting that team to suddenly compete for wins overnight is lunacy. Haas F1 joined the grid in 2016 and still isn’t close to hoping for a win. Cadillac is joining next  season and isn’t hoping to compete for wins until 2030 at best. 

The movie just does not care at all about when or why Safety Cars or Red Flags are declared. 

The premise itself of a driver coming back after 30 years away is obviously ridiculous. And doing so with no prep on top of that? Competing physically in F1 requires physical prep that even active drivers of other racing leagues would struggle with. 

The movie doesn’t acknowledge the practice sessions that happen before races, and barely acknowledges qualifying. Drivers don’t just show up on Sunday and race. The race weekend starts for them on Wednesday or Thursday. 

Obviously, the actual racing maneuvers and pace differences are complete nonsense. 

“They’ve got us beat in the straights, but we can fight in the turns” …it is SO much harder to be faster in the turns  than on the straights. In fact, it used to be very common for struggling and underfunded F1 teams to intentionally reduce their downforce in turns to gain more speed on the straights. It’s cheap and easy to do

The movie starts with the 24hrs of Daytona and then Sonny leaves that to join F1 9 races into the F1 season. But the 24hrs of Daytona actually happens in January, usually about a month or two before the F1 season starts.

- The Daytona opening is so good! It was what I imagine live action Cars or Days of Thunder sequel would be like
- The quickly addressed why Sonny Hayes (at his age) would be a F1 driver and making his experience a focal point of the movie 
- The movie is a lot funnier than expected. Using loopholes to close gaps and winning the races is an interesting angle for a main protagonist
- Brad Pitt easily carries this movie with his charisma but Kerry Condon steals the movie for me. I'm glad that she used her actual accent for the movie
- Damson Idris is good in the movie but slightly underdeveloped. It may be due to Simone Ashley's role being cut which lessened his characterization. Also, cutting Simone Ashley but only showing one frame of her during the British Grand Prix is kinda diabolical. 
- The racing scenes are exhilarating. It is basically like Top Gun Maverick but with cars. The editing in those racing scenes is excellent and easily should be the frontrunner for an Oscar. 
- Only drawback of the movie was the music for me. There were too many needle drops instead of actual score. 
- The final 3-lap sprint with the double sacrifice is one of my favourite endings.

&gt;From Apple Original Films and the filmmakers from Top Gun: Maverick comes the high-octane, action-packed feature film F1, starring Brad Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski.  The film is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Kosinski, seven-time FORMULA 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner and Chad Oman.

&gt;Dubbed “the greatest that never was,” Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) was FORMULA 1’s most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career.  Thirty years later, he’s a nomadic racer-for-hire when he’s approached by his former teammate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), owner of a struggling FORMULA 1 team that is on the verge of collapse.  Ruben convinces Sonny to come back to FORMULA 1 for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world.  He’ll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace.  But as the engines roar, Sonny’s past catches up with him and he finds that in FORMULA 1, your teammate is your fiercest competition—and the road to redemption is not something you can travel alone.

&gt;F1 also stars Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, Kim Bodnia, and Javier Bardem, and has been shot during actual Grand Prix weekends as the team competes against the titans of the sport.

&gt;Kosinski directs from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger.  The film is executive produced by Daniel Lupi.  Collaborating with Kosinski behind the scenes are his creative team, including director of photography Claudio Miranda, production designers Mark Tildesley and Ben Munro, editor Stephen Mirrione, costume designer Julian Day, casting director Lucy Bevan and composer Hans Zimmer.

But as mentioned, DC's brand is at an all-time low and they're currently struggling to gain good will with the audience. ***Superman*** is the first step in building that good will. After all, the character has had very rough decades; the Christopher Reeve films fizzled out by the end, ***Superman Returns*** disappointed\*\*\*, and the DCEU Superman didn't fully connect with audiences.

This is why I think the success of DC is doomed to not be as durable as Warners might hope: it will take a run of several films to establish good-will, wash the bad taste of the previous iteration, get out from under the shadow of Marvel AND get up to speed and only then they might afford to rest on their laurels a little, were it not for the fact that by that time, the overall superhero fatigue may get to such a pitch as to render the entire endeavour anachronistic.

In the short run, however, the success of this film - following those of Final Destination, Sinners and Minecraft, and the corporate bloodletting that preceded it all - will help keep the struggling juggernaut afloat and give a quieter home front to other, hopefully more interesting projects at work in New Line Cinema and elsewhere under the Warners flag.",0.099,0.747,0.155,0.9468,Positive,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Absolutely incredible honestly. The additional fact that none of the movies were terrible is wild, sure there were some sub par ones like Thor 2, but still a fine popcorn flick. And then finally at the end of the day they managed to tell an overarching story in that time period as well.

The subject matter of the new Superman movie is pretty dark. It tackles real, current, modern day issues but transposes them into the absurdity that are comic books. This really felt like a movie made for *today*, not a movie made in the pretend version of America that Hollywood likes to pretend still exists.

Just because a movie has jokes doesn't mean it can't also be handling tough subject matter in a genuine way.

Yeah its fun to put up lines like ""#1 movie in the world"" and ""made a billion dollars worldwide"" but the actual yield is low even against the 50/50 domestic split because when you go to other countries you lose cuts to local partners, doing marketing to local tastes, money changers to bring anything home, etc. And in reality most of these movies are sort only so-so in popularity in the first place, doing okay money not 'event' money. James Cameron is the only one who's figured out how to make actually super popular movies everywhere with any reliability.

Just looking at the film, it's obviously a lot more expensive and there's plenty of room for both hefty profits and cost increases in those numbers. There should be an unreported on greek tax credit that gives more details on true spending but it wasn't trivially easy to find (I'd need to know the local production entity) so I gave up.


Similarly, we can look at Knives Out 3 and see that part way through filming RJ paid himself $25M pounds to write and direct while Bergman is paid $15M pounds to produce. That's already over $40M *before* making the film or accounting for Craig's salary. Director salary, producer fees, Craig's Salary, etc. are all real costs the film needs to incur. 

Those are real ""insane"" costs for a midbudget murder mystery film...except they're not insane because these costs are a reflection of Netflix's purchase price so it's basically profit sharing.

&gt; According to the countersuit, “Pitt choked one of the children and struck another in the face” and “grabbed Jolie by the head and shook her” during the 2016 altercation. Jolie’s lawyer states the dispute started when Pitt accused her of being “too deferential” to their kids. The two started fighting in the plane’s bathroom.




&gt; “Pitt grabbed Jolie by the head and shook her, and then grabbed her shoulders and shook her again before pushing her into the bathroom wall,” the countersuit reads. “Pitt then punched the ceiling of the plane numerous times, prompting Jolie to leave the bathroom.”



&gt; The countersuit states that Pitt attempted to get physical with one of their kids after the child came to Jolie’s defense.



&gt; “When one of the children verbally defended Jolie, Pitt lunged at his own child and Jolie grabbed him from behind to stop him,” the countersuit states. “To get Jolie off his back, Pitt threw himself backwards into the airplane’s seats injuring Jolie’s back and elbow. The children rushed in and all bravely tried to protect each other. Before it was over, Pitt choked one of the children and struck another in the face. Some of the children pleaded with Pitt to stop. They were all frightened. Many were crying.”


&gt; Jolie “arranged for separate transportation at the airport” to bring her and the children to a hotel without Pitt, the suit continues. “She then went to wake Pitt up and told him that she and the children were going to a hotel. Pitt once again screamed at her, and pushed her down yet again.”

&gt; As reported in August, Jolie was behind an anonymous 2016 lawsuit in which the plaintiff alleged being assaulted by her “then-husband” on a private plane. The actor told an FBI agent that Pitt “physically and verbally assaulted” her and their children, and the agent went on to meet with the assistant U.S. attorney. The agent concluded they would not pursue criminal charges, causing Jolie to anonymously file a Freedom of Information Act suit against the FBI in order to obtain documents related to the federal investigation against Pitt.




&gt; In the new countersuit, Jolie’s lawyer states that the FBI agent who investigated the allegations had “concluded that the government had probable cause to charge Pitt with a federal crime for his conduct that day.”",0.092,0.872,0.036,-0.9596,Negative,0,1,0,1,1,0,0

When it gets to be a streaming movie instead. 

Back when a 32 inch Trinitron was a “big screen” of course folks were going to the theater more.

But now the home experience is soooo much better, shit you can get a 75 inch widescreen TV for 500 bucks if you’re not super anal about the fine details of the picture.  Tack on a virtual surround soundbar with a sub. 

You can pause. Use the restroom. Get a drink that’s already in your fridge. Then stream it in 4K.

Of course the year or so that theaters closed for Covid just entrenched this “streaming” mindset in people. 

I wish the type of adult dramas and comedies I grew up with would still bring the people to the theater but it’s really not happening anymore.

Studios can greenlight as many daring exciting ideas as they like but that doesn't mean that a) the general public will go see them enough to justify a paradigm shift in film budgets and b) studios will stop making as-close-to-guaranteed moneymakers as possible. 

The difference between now and the last time it felt like a new idea could be a genuine smash hit was, what, maybe the 90s? Back then, the newest original idea film would be the buzz of the season or at least the week or two. Have you had a casual conversation with anyone, outside of Reddit, about the symbolic undertones of Eddington? Do people even talk about the big twist ending to that film? Weapons came closest, I think, to being a big bold public push but they're already trying to capitalize on the one major character with spinoff potential and giving her a prequel. 

There are outliers of course. For a while, Jordan Peele's original ideas seemed like big deals, for instance. Genre-filmmaking will always have a few big hits, like horror with Terrifier or comedy with Nobody or Novocaine.

The issue is streaming has diluted the pool of entertainment.

Up front it's just incredibly well paced. Like OP said it just flies by somehow. But there's so much attention to detail. There's so many small insignificant things that are given no highlights that come in later. I definitely think there's a strong argument for watching it twice because there's a lot of stuff with Bob at the start of the movie pre-kid that seems like dressing and knowing how he ends up and what he has to deal with makes it more interesting. And the performances are really good. Sean Penn is so goddamn weird but still grounded in a way that feels vaguely like I've met that kind of guy before. Leo being a struggling fuck up who's energy is at a 10 almost the whole movie is super entertaining. And in particular the whole segment where hes with Del Toro is amazing for what is happening as a whole. There is so much to take in between what Bob's doing, what Del Toro is doing, and what the background is doing. There's some really entertaining coregraphy for that whole portion of the movie.",0.102,0.704,0.194,0.9735,Positive,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

There were tons of walkouts at that one though. Imagine walking out before Rose fucking' Byrne comes on for a Q&amp;A. Couldn't be me.

The movies that had the most walkouts this year:

* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You**
* **[The Chronology of Water](https://i.imgur.com/iRt4Y0a.jpeg)** (i swear at least 150 people walked out of this one)
* **[The Testament of Ann Lee](https://i.imgur.com/HzGkRUj.jpeg)** 

The first two make sense. Those movies are *aggressive*. They actively don't give a shit about your feelings. They want to make you feel like shit. **Ann Lee** makes no sense, nobody should be walking out of that. If you walk out of **Ann Lee** we can't be friends.

Marty Supreme,I saw 290 movies in theaters in 2025. Here is my full ranking.,reddit,"Here are some reviews/thoughts I had to cut to fit the maximum character count:

* **The Threesome** - 8/10 - Really really really great stuff. Smart, funny, heartfelt. It could be a really cheesy setup (threesome goes horribly wrong), but it takes lots of turns you don't expect and it's super smartly written and excellently acted (especially Zoey Deutsch). Sweet little comfort movie. Dope soundtrack too.	

* **Final Destination: Bloodlines** 8/10 - I've always had a soft-spot for the original, but the other movies didn't do much for me and I even skipped some. Was originally going to skip this one but really glad I didn't. A new high-point for the series. Kind of everything I want in a horror. Funny, surprisingly, nasty/hilarious kills. It subverts your expectations at every corner and has one of the best mic-drop endings of the year. Give me more

* **Bring Her Back** - 8/10  Jesus christ. Really great horror film, and apart from one very weird/jarring/out-of-place tonal shift near the end (when there's the cleaning montage and the one-liner of the girl playing ball), it's consitent throughout.	

* **Christy** - 7/10 - It’s a boxing biopic with a tragic 2nd act and a happy ending. You’ve seen it a million times, but really solid lead performances from Sydney Sweeney (in her best role yet) and Ben Foster (at his most reviling) and a sweeping, war-movie-like orchestral score keep it engaging throughout. Chad Coleman only has a few minutes of screentime but he makes them memorable as Don King, highlight of the movie for me. In a just world, he’d get Supporting Actor Oscar buzz. 	

* **The Surfer** - 7/10 - Pretty challenging watch and will test a lot of people's patience but it ultimately pays off, even though you're left with a lot of questions (in a good way). Another classic weird-Cage performance that builds up perfectly. Loved all of the extremely-uncomfortable close-ups. You doubt yourself for a lot of the movie which I really enjoyed.	
* **Blue Heron** - 7/10 - Canada's *We Need To Talk About Kevin*. Unfortunately, the subtitles weren't on during my screening so I probably missed some important stuff, but it's an impressive debut film with a complicated-but-well-done timeline.	

* **A Big Beautiful Journey** - 7/10 - Everyone hates it, I liked it. Yes it drags a bit in the middle and some of the 'visiting the past' scenes are weird (50-year old Colin Farrell confessing love to his 15-year old high school crush...?), and I would pay money for the 3-minute Burger King ad in the middle to not exist, but the soundtrack/needle drops were built in a lab specifically for me and there's a lot of sweet moments. It's corny in the best way, filled with goofy lines like ""I prefer to feel nervous with you than nothing alone"", which just kinda worked for me.	

* **The Wizard of the Kremlin** - 7/10 - There's a 9/10 movie in here somewhere with some better editing/pacing. Literally all of the first ~30 minutes can be cut. Jeffrey Wright can be cut, Alicia Vikander can be cut. Concentrate more on Putin and you've got a stew going. Right now, it's a bunch of solid potential and great performances that result in not much of anything. Paul Dano trying to play a teenager for a few scenes was very not good. Good movie, could be a lot better.

* **On Swift Horses** - 7/10 - A bit long and melodramatic but kept you engaged enough (with two intertwined storylines) to keep it interesting. Daisy Edgar Jones is great (+ some steamy lesbian sex scenes for all u sick pervs). Kinda over Jacob Elordi's schtick though. He's played the same character for like 5 movies in a row. He's always just doing a James Dean impression.	

* **Rust** - 7/10 - Went in with rock-bottom expectations but it was surprisingly solid. Very well writen and well shot, with solid performances (especially Travis Fimmel, one of the best supporting performances of the year so far). It's definitely a bit slow and long (most people will get bored), but the dialogue really works and there's a lot of depth to the worldbuilding. Hard to ignore the tragedy during the movie though, the movie starts off with someone accidentally shooting someone and you're just like ""oof"".	

* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You** - 6/10 - Rose Byrne puts in an incredible performance and is supported by a great cast, especially Conan O’Brien and ASAP Rocky) who’s starting to pop up and standout in lots of things recently), but the constant close-ups and confusing drug &amp; alcohol-induced blow-ups keep it from going great. They got a bit repetitive. The smashed-hamster to lasagna sequence was top-tier as far as transitions go though. 	

* **Hard Truths** - 5/10 - Introduces you to possibly the most irritating character ever put on the big screen (and not in a good way like *Naked*), with zero redeeming qualities and no arc, with a frustratingly pointless ending. Very very rough. I know that Mike Leigh won't hold your hand and answer all of the questions, but sheesh, I needed something more. Huge disappointment.

* **Fuze** - 5/10 -  I haven’t seen a third act derailment this bad since *White Noise*. Just a total mess in the last 30 minutes that completely kills a somewhat-decent premise. I don't know if David Mackenzie has another *Hell or High Water* in him.

* **Eastern Western** - 3/10 - If you thought Kevin Costner's *Horizon* was slow, wait until you get a hold of this. The hardest I had to fight to slay asleep all year. Would make for a good white noise machine to fall asleep.	

* **High Rollers** - 3/10 - You'll see a lot of people joke about movies being money laundering schemes, but this could *actually* be one. The director, Randall Emmett, is probably the shadiest dude in Hollywood. He keeps bankrolling John Travolta's straight-to-the-garbage-bin movies somehow. A documentary about how his films are made would undoubetdly be more interesting than this trash.

Marty Supreme,Josh Safdie's 'Marty Supreme' Review Thread,reddit,"From Brian Tallarico's review...


&gt;That’s where he sleeps with an old friend and neighbor named Rachel (Odessa A’zion), who’s married to a Stanley-esque brute named Ira (Emory Cohen) but is clearly in love with the captivating Marty. 


&gt;That’s where he spots former box office queen Kay Stone (Gwyneth Paltrow) walking through the lobby, and he’s instantly drawn to her star power, even if it’s somewhat faded. Marty talks his way into Kay’s life (and bed) through sheer bravado, even trying to coordinate business deals with Kay’s husband, Milton (Kevin O’Leary of “Shark Tank” fame), while he sleeps with his wife.


Obviously, I haven't seen the movie. But I will just never understand this obsession so many writers have with the idea that every married woman is just waiting to cheat, every man wants to be the one she does it with, and this is all light-hearted, cool and even aspirational.

Has this notion that women are all selfish, dishonest and primarily motivated by having sex with ""better"" men (or that men need to be constantly competing with other men for that role, and getting it is the ultimate triumph) done anything good for our society, between Elliot Rodger and Andrew Tate? Why promote it further?

I find it bizarre that people continue to write and take roles in these puerile and pessimistic narratives, while presenting them as funny or romantic, as if love can never be more than social Darwinism. What's even the appeal to the audience? I guarantee there are more Emory Cohens than Timothee Chalamets out there.

Of course, perhaps this goes in a vastly different direction than I'm expecting. But from what I've read, I doubt it.",0.077,0.761,0.162,0.9828,Positive,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Marty Supreme,Josh Safdie's 'Marty Supreme' Review Thread,reddit,"You should actually watch the movie before projecting onto the film whatever cliche social shenanigans you're assuming will be playing out.  

The whole point was exactly that Marty's hustler persona was not getting him anywhere like he originally thought it was.  Gwyneth's character, as well, didn't end up anywhere satisfying.  And also her husband was not portrayed with any glory.  

Basically everyone who was in their ego, social climbing, or living for themselves alone, rather than living from an authentic heart-centered place of loyalty, is shown as doing life wrong.  

The Japanese ping pong master is symbolic of something very beautiful, something that requires no outside validation.  It all makes sense in the film, if you'd actually watch it before commenting.

Marty Supreme,‘Marty Supreme’ Heading To China; Timothée Chalamet Pic Bound To Become A24’s Highest Grossing Ever At Global B.O.,reddit,I’ll say this and hope people can read it objectively. This movie was not that great at all. Safdie used pacing to excite the viewer even when little is going on and the characters are boring. Chalamet doesn’t do a great job — basically plays himself but high strung. Doesn’t sound like a Jewish person from Manhattan during the time period while others do. Characters are eternally annoying and scheming while the emotional plug at the end feels cheap. Their motivations and actions are questionable on multiple occasions. I’ve like a lot of movies this year but not this one — it was a B-. I think everyone lauds Safdie for Uncut Gems (I like Good Time) and so they want to get on board with his success and not be late to the party. ,0.062,0.729,0.208,0.9715,Positive,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
Marty Supreme,‘Marty Supreme’ Heading To China; Timothée Chalamet Pic Bound To Become A24’s Highest Grossing Ever At Global B.O.,reddit,"I disagree so hard. And I need a refresh, but I remember hating Uncut Gems.

I found the characters so much more interesting and complex than that. Most of them are bad in their own way, but have redeeming qualities and their motivations and actions seemed clearly in line with the way they were painted.

And I don’t think the ending was a cheap emotional plug at all. I wasn’t deeply moved, but it didn’t feel like the intention to me. It was a great way to wrap up his story arc from ditching everything, doing wrong by so many people just to achieve his goal, just to go back to the core of love, care, and responsibility.

I see so many critiques about Marty not “getting what he deserved”, and I wonder why every movie needs to have direct actions and consequences, when life just isn’t that simple. It felt like a character study in that way, and people are left to draw their own conclusions.

I’m likely not adding much to the discussion, but I really loved this one so wanted to reply. Movie of the year in my opinion.",0.071,0.766,0.163,0.9758,Positive,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

I wanted to, but sometimes it just doesn’t hit. Didn’t see many redeeming qualities when everything was a ploy and manipulation to advance self interest — Marty ping pong sleeping with another man’s wife and his love interest being fake beat up and adulterer. They’re really pretty awful people full stop. Why do I have to root for them?

I’ll get downvoted some more but I don’t mind expressing my opinion. For the record — I think downvotes should be a tool for someone that writes a poor comment not something you don’t agree with, but it’s Reddit. Marty Supreme was a great movie for casual movie fans, felt like a blockbuster pretending to be an indie film. 

I think Chalamet is a great actor, I remember saying that as the film ended. But his characterization of a 50s Jewish person from Manhattan just did not sound like it. Am I wrong about this? Didn’t he sound like a sped up Chalamet the whole time? For me that’s more like Gene Hackman or Brad Pitt who mostly play themselves instead of someone like Gary Oldman who just melts into the character.

I think your critique of “not getting what he deserved” is strange. It’s not that kind of movie. But I still think how in the last 5 mins he does a 180 and is now a caring father. Hey, I’m glad and it isn’t a bad way to end it. Just felt like there could have been more movement to his core character instead of hey I won my ping pong match now I can be a good dad/person.

Saying movie of the year seriously makes me question what else you have seen.  Sinners? One Battle After Another? Hamnet? Sentimental Value? All better. I haven’t seen Train Dreams, No Other Choice, or Bugonia but I’ll probably like those more.

Studios spend millions on PR. 

I’ve seen Marty supreme. It’s a decently solid movie, it was paced well and it was directed with a clear and clean objective. The acting was good too, all around the entire cast was pretty good. Timmy was good, but he wasn’t great. And this film and Timmy, in my opinion, do not hold the same cultural, or societal impact that other current films/performances hold right now. 

I felt that Timmy’s performance in a complete unknown, was a far better performance than his turn in Morty supreme. In my opinion, Gwyneth stole the movie. And she stole ever seen she was in. She single-handedly out-acted Timmy because she was a bit more lived in her performance. And At times it was apparent that Timothée Chalamet was delivering a performance, as opposed to, watching Marty supreme come to life.

Marty Supreme,Official Discussion - Marty Supreme [SPOILERS],reddit,"I absolutely loved this one. In classic Safdie brother fashion, Josh has managed to make a movie centered around a morally reprehensible character a thrill to watch from start to finish. However that wouldn’t be possible without Timothée Chalamet’s incredible performance. I mean wow, I knew he had the chops from his previous roles but this was next level. Marty is a narcissist, cheater, deadbeat, compulsive liar, thief, and so much more but even then I found myself rooting for the guy. I don’t think that would be possible without what Chalamet brings to the role.

Everyone else brought their A-game too, and I was thoroughly impressed by Odessa A’zion’s performance here (having not seen any of her other roles before this). The score was top-notch as well, and it all perfectly culminates in that classic Safdie pacing where I constantly felt like the walls were closing in around me, just like they were for Marty. The dude has that Trump-like quality where he just manages to get out of any sticky situation that he finds himself in, though. When it cut to him boarding that military plane to get back to New York at the end I couldn’t help but laugh. No wonder he was a good salesman!

Marty Supreme,Official Discussion - Marty Supreme [SPOILERS],reddit,"Two minor thoughts I had at the end.

First, a little miffed they didn't bring out the orange ball at the end considering both were wearing white and it would have been a chance to redeem his relationship with his friend if they got paid for that investment.

Second, and not sure if I'm as committed to this one, but if Marty lost the end and had the same exact same reaction to Endo (saying that Endo would win and all that and being humble), the ending would have been sold to me a little better? I'm not fully convinced that Marty has changed enough to be the father he needs to be. I don't think anything else would really need to change with him losing, thinking back. 

Anyway, really liked the film. Definitely my favorite of the year.",0.068,0.777,0.156,0.9372,Positive,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Marty Supreme,Official Discussion - Marty Supreme [SPOILERS],reddit,"I don't think he changed by the end either. After learning he couldn't compete and wasted his time coming to Tokyo, he accomplished his goal how he could... beating Endo and proving that even if Endo wins the championship, he beat him. 

He doesn't want to go back, he doesn't have a choice. He doesn't want to settle down. He doesn't want to be a father. And that's why he's crying, and why the baby cries continue  into the credits. 

A cool thing I heard Josh Safdie say was that the music is 80s because in his head the story is being told when Marty is middle aged, reflecting.. which would be in the 80s.. so I'm taking it as he does end up changing, we just don't see it, we only hear it in the lyrics of the 80s music he's currently reflecting on.",0.077,0.819,0.104,0.7552,Positive,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
Marty Supreme,Official Discussion - Marty Supreme [SPOILERS],reddit,"I'm not fully convinced that he was crying because he didn't want fatherhood. He seemed excited and happy at the end. His face wasn't ambiguous at all. He seemed genuine coming back to Rachel and saying he loves her and taking ownership of being the father. All of that was the opposite of what we had seen from the rest of the movie, so it definitely seemed like they were trying to show his change. Like, if Marty didn't want to be a father, he could just run like he did during the rest of the movie. I also definitely don't think the babies crying were meant to incite terror or anxiety lol. 

I think fatherhood is the ultimate symbol of living for something outside of yourself. I think they wanted to show that journey to the end in Marty, and maybe him winning the game was a way to ""unstuck"" himself from the mental block of losing the first time? But you're right I'm not convinced he's come that far. It seemed more symbolic at the end than it did the actual conclusion of the story?",0.089,0.814,0.097,0.4025,Positive,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Maybe it was just me, but I thought the baby looked wayyyy more like Ira than Marty. And almost the exact moment that thought crossed my mind, the camera cuts back to Marty and you see it flicker across his face too; he goes from relief and awe to something way more complicated. Doubt, recognition, maybe the realization that he never had the upper hand. Unbelievable acting by Chalamet. 

What makes it land is that Rachel is basically Marty’s character mirror throughout the entire film. She lies, hustles, and schemes her way into getting what she wants, and for once he’s the one left holding the fallout. The fake black eye, the baby, the mess…it’s Marty’s playbook, except he’s the one caught holding bag in the end.

Not entirely sure what I think of the ending. Marty is a pretty one-note character throughout the film, in a way that is very similar to the protagonists of *Good Time* and *Uncut Gems*, but whereas those guys both arrive at a point of total ruination as a result of all their bad decisions, Marty's ending seems to suggest a genuine shift in his character, and one that I don't know that I really buy based on what we've seen to this point.

I thought the first and third acts were the most compelling.

I thought the sports scenes were incredibly well done. I wanted even more of that!

Also conflicted about the ending. If they were going for a redemption arc, I didn't think it felt earned based on Marty's actions.

Honestly this could be exactly what has them so nervous. It's one thing to give this to QT. He's one of the most well known directors around, he has a long track record, and perhaps most importantly his movies are more valuable for the prestige they're bringing the studio than the money. Don't get me wrong, his movies make money, but he's not a particularly commercial director.

Coogler, on the other hand, has a much shorter track record and most of his success has come with franchise movies. If he's demanding this type of deal it really widens who's going to get them, while also increasing the downside for the studios because they're losing rights to more commercial work that has more financial value to them.

You are spot on about variety's service to studio execs. Variety was at the forefront of the Rachel Zegler hate campaign blaming her for the poor performance of Snow White even though she was the best part of the movie. This was due to Marc Platt being furious about Rachel Zegler's 'free Palestine' tweet and she refused to take it down to the point he flew to New York to admonish her but she stood her ground and clearly Marc took aim for her career.


Ryan coogler's deal for Sinners has a first dollar agreement where Ryan will start getting a cut of sales from the opening weekend of the movie. Usually, the studio makes it's money back first and then they will start paying back end deals. Also the ownership of sinners will revert back to Ryan coogler after 25 years, which is makes sinners an IP that the company is eventually going to lose. Also, to get sinners greenlit Ryan pit studios against each other with a bidding war to get a higher budget for the film so the studio might have ended up paying more for the movie than the intended. Ryan coogler also demanded to have the final cut edit for the film.


these terms are favourable to Ryan yes but not to the execs.  All these agreements are rare by themselves let alone for one picture and there is some executive who is not happy about this. So the next thing Is to set Ryan up for failure by setting the bar much higher than what's usual for these kinds of films (also considering that it's an original horror flick with a majority black cast). Seems like they are setting the stage to brand it a flop, Ryan's career takes a hit, he is knocked down a peg or three and he won't be able to make such high demands in the future.

Up front it's just incredibly well paced. Like OP said it just flies by somehow. But there's so much attention to detail. There's so many small insignificant things that are given no highlights that come in later. I definitely think there's a strong argument for watching it twice because there's a lot of stuff with Bob at the start of the movie pre-kid that seems like dressing and knowing how he ends up and what he has to deal with makes it more interesting. And the performances are really good. Sean Penn is so goddamn weird but still grounded in a way that feels vaguely like I've met that kind of guy before. Leo being a struggling fuck up who's energy is at a 10 almost the whole movie is super entertaining. And in particular the whole segment where hes with Del Toro is amazing for what is happening as a whole. There is so much to take in between what Bob's doing, what Del Toro is doing, and what the background is doing.

Sinners movie,I saw 290 movies in theaters in 2025. Here is my full ranking.,reddit,"Here are some reviews/thoughts I had to cut to fit the maximum character count:

* **The Threesome** - 8/10 - Really really really great stuff. Smart, funny, heartfelt. It could be a really cheesy setup (threesome goes horribly wrong), but it takes lots of turns you don't expect and it's super smartly written and excellently acted (especially Zoey Deutsch). Sweet little comfort movie. Dope soundtrack too.	

* **Final Destination: Bloodlines** 8/10 - I've always had a soft-spot for the original, but the other movies didn't do much for me and I even skipped some. Was originally going to skip this one but really glad I didn't. A new high-point for the series. Kind of everything I want in a horror. Funny, surprisingly, nasty/hilarious kills. It subverts your expectations at every corner and has one of the best mic-drop endings of the year. Give me more

* **Bring Her Back** - 8/10  Jesus christ. Really great horror film, and apart from one very weird/jarring/out-of-place tonal shift near the end (when there's the cleaning montage and the one-liner of the girl playing ball), it's consitent throughout.	

* **Christy** - 7/10 - It’s a boxing biopic with a tragic 2nd act and a happy ending. You’ve seen it a million times, but really solid lead performances from Sydney Sweeney (in her best role yet) and Ben Foster (at his most reviling) and a sweeping, war-movie-like orchestral score keep it engaging throughout. Chad Coleman only has a few minutes of screentime but he makes them memorable as Don King, highlight of the movie for me. In a just world, he’d get Supporting Actor Oscar buzz. 	

* **The Surfer** - 7/10 - Pretty challenging watch and will test a lot of people's patience but it ultimately pays off, even though you're left with a lot of questions (in a good way). Another classic weird-Cage performance that builds up perfectly. Loved all of the extremely-uncomfortable close-ups. You doubt yourself for a lot of the movie which I really enjoyed.	
* **Blue Heron** - 7/10 - Canada's *We Need To Talk About Kevin*. Unfortunately, the subtitles weren't on during my screening so I probably missed some important stuff, but it's an impressive debut film with a complicated-but-well-done timeline.	

* **A Big Beautiful Journey** - 7/10 - Everyone hates it, I liked it. Yes it drags a bit in the middle and some of the 'visiting the past' scenes are weird (50-year old Colin Farrell confessing love to his 15-year old high school crush...?), and I would pay money for the 3-minute Burger King ad in the middle to not exist, but the soundtrack/needle drops were built in a lab specifically for me and there's a lot of sweet moments. It's corny in the best way, filled with goofy lines like ""I prefer to feel nervous with you than nothing alone"", which just kinda worked for me.	

* **The Wizard of the Kremlin** - 7/10 - There's a 9/10 movie in here somewhere with some better editing/pacing. Literally all of the first ~30 minutes can be cut. Jeffrey Wright can be cut, Alicia Vikander can be cut. Concentrate more on Putin and you've got a stew going. Right now, it's a bunch of solid potential and great performances that result in not much of anything. Paul Dano trying to play a teenager for a few scenes was very not good. Good movie, could be a lot better.

* **On Swift Horses** - 7/10 - A bit long and melodramatic but kept you engaged enough (with two intertwined storylines) to keep it interesting. Daisy Edgar Jones is great (+ some steamy lesbian sex scenes for all u sick pervs). Kinda over Jacob Elordi's schtick though. He's played the same character for like 5 movies in a row. He's always just doing a James Dean impression.	

* **Rust** - 7/10 - Went in with rock-bottom expectations but it was surprisingly solid. Very well writen and well shot, with solid performances (especially Travis Fimmel, one of the best supporting performances of the year so far). It's definitely a bit slow and long (most people will get bored), but the dialogue really works and there's a lot of depth to the worldbuilding. Hard to ignore the tragedy during the movie though, the movie starts off with someone accidentally shooting someone and you're just like ""oof"".	

* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You** - 6/10 - Rose Byrne puts in an incredible performance and is supported by a great cast, especially Conan O’Brien and ASAP Rocky) who’s starting to pop up and standout in lots of things recently), but the constant close-ups and confusing drug &amp; alcohol-induced blow-ups keep it from going great. They got a bit repetitive. The smashed-hamster to lasagna sequence was top-tier as far as transitions go though. 	

* **Hard Truths** - 5/10 - Introduces you to possibly the most irritating character ever put on the big screen (and not in a good way like *Naked*), with zero redeeming qualities and no arc, with a frustratingly pointless ending. Very very rough. I know that Mike Leigh won't hold your hand and answer all of the questions, but sheesh, I needed something more. Huge disappointment.

* **Fuze** - 5/10 -  I haven’t seen a third act derailment this bad since *White Noise*. Just a total mess in the last 30 minutes that completely kills a somewhat-decent premise. I don't know if David Mackenzie has another *Hell or High Water* in him.

* **Eastern Western** - 3/10 - If you thought Kevin Costner's *Horizon* was slow, wait until you get a hold of this. The hardest I had to fight to slay asleep all year. Would make for a good white noise machine to fall asleep.	

* **High Rollers** - 3/10 - You'll see a lot of people joke about movies being money laundering schemes, but this could *actually* be one. The director, Randall Emmett, is probably the shadiest dude in Hollywood. He keeps bankrolling John Travolta's straight-to-the-garbage-bin movies somehow. A documentary about how his films are made would undoubetdly be more interesting than this trash.

* **Good American Family** - 3/10 - Garbage streaming true-crime slop. Very messy. It wants to be serious and dark but it's so cartoony and poorly executed. It's filmed like a car commercial. But Mark Duplass is the champion of indie film so I'll always support. He basically admitted (several times) during the Q&amp;A that he basically took this gig to fund his more serious, indie films.",0.104,0.695,0.2,0.9993,Positive,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

I will say they do shadow and maria way better than the games and thats the main reason i disagree from the rating, if i ignore my fan bias and just look at the disjointed story. Its not just a sick child and her protector, its a mischievous granddaughter and an innocent alien becoming best friends. They are a little on the nose with the antithesis of sonic and shadow, but if you look at them each independently they are both good. 

The other part i will praise is jim carey played two very similar characters very differently. Ivo is evil but almost innocent with his trust, gerald is broken and beyond saving. They are truly different characters.",0.122,0.625,0.253,0.9828,Positive,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Novocaine, Fly Me to the Moon, and The Amateur have been pretty ""meh"" rated all around. Horizon was mostly negative. Red One, The Alto Knights, and Megalopolis are almost universally considered fucking abominations.

What this write-up failed to mention is that making original movies isn't the only thing audiences are asking for. They're asking for *GOOD* original movies.

The Minecraft movie is on track to make a billion dollars. So, yes, they do. Because people do.

Do you see the problem here? It's the same issue every single time this comes up on r/movies. An original movie has to be good, interesting, and well-advertised, and it has to play in a clean theater, and then *maybe* we'll all go see it (and if its all of those things, and still fails, we'll say it was secretly bad or poorly advertised or whatever).

**IP-driven movies need none of that**. They don't need to be good. The marketing can be cringy--sometimes that just makes people want to watch it more. The movie theater can be people throwing things at the screen. It doesn't matter.

We've basically seen what caused the death of arcades, the home experience has caught up to the theater experience, at least enough to where going to the theater isn't worth it most of the time.  

At the theater, I have to deal with people on their phones, talking, babies, people crunching, etc. I can't pause to take a piss or a refill, the seats, while better, are still weirdly uncomfortable, the audio is sometimes insane and I can't put on subtitles.  

At home, I get a good enough sized screen and the sound quality is good enough.  Is it as a good as a theater? No, but it's also not a 20-30 inch CRT at 240p with 2 tinny speakers.  

Also fuck ads.  Every time I go to the theater before we even get previews we get 5-10 minutes of straight ads after spending $15-30 on a ticket.  Fuck that.

Similar to the console to arcade analogy, you'll never replace a full scale Daytona or After Burner cabinet, but that's a unique experience.

Sinners movie,Official Discussion - Sinners [SPOILERS],reddit,"Y’all, I’m not gonna bury the lede here. Sinners is a 10/10, it’s the best thing I’ve seen in a long while. It’s everything I want in a movie. It’s super badass, it’s sexy, it’s funny, it’s mystical, it makes wild choices, it pulls no punches, it’s a period piece, a musical, a horror film, a social commentary. It never stops being the most insane and awesome vampire movie while the themes run deep through every scene. This is exactly the kind of best case scenario for Coogler who has spent the last decade plus making big studio IP films to kick down the doors and remind us he doesn’t need any of that to make a great fucking movie. 

There is a sequence in this movie that had me levitating out of my seat with tears down my face, and I struggle between not spoiling it here but wanting to discuss it in depth. But I do want to talk about what this movie is getting at, because it’s such a brilliantly nuanced conversation taking place in a legit vampire movie and neither ever feel forced together. On the surface it might be easy to compare this to a Peele film or say it’s all about race, but really it’s just as much about culture. This movie is about why creating space for furthering the culture through art is important. The sequence I’m referring to is a little abstract and it’s the first time this movie’s thesis really opens up, but it’s so incredible. Musically and visually and thematically it’s an absolute home run and feels like Coogler showing off what he’s had up his sleeve all this time. And the horror of this movie begins with the end of that sequence, when you see the three vampires watching these people have a great time and while it’s not stated out loud, the visual message here is that these boring cultural vampires cannot stand not being invited to join the party. And that’s about to ruin everyone’s night. 

I honestly feel like this movie does such a fantastic job of conveying its theme that I will do it a disservice here, but I’m going to try. The lore of this movie is that some people are so fucking good at making music that they awaken evil spirits to challenge them, which is already cool as hell. Sammie is the one the vampires want the most. Why? Because he’s culturally significant. The vampires want him to become one of their collective consciousness, sharing his music and talents with the monoculture. But these people that have worked so hard to carve out a space for themselves know Sammie is meant to enrich their specific culture, that’s why they're so protective of him and why Smoke basically threatens him to stay. It’s not about keeping anyone out, it’s about how when there’s plenty of places to go enjoy folk music or the mainstream, there should be no problem with there also being a space for the minority culture to thrive. 

And how about these vampires? This movie is hilarious as much as it is frightening, and the vampires being Irish sea shanty folk singers is maybe the funniest thing about it. I didn’t take it as a knock on any specific culture, but folk music like that is so dependent on synchronization and unity while the cultures being explored in that club music scene feels much more based in individuality and unexpected flavor. It’s so genius to make that the collective consciousness style and how their ultimate goal is to consume other cultural art to be one with their mainstream ideals. It actually works so well with the old lore of vampires, for example them needing to be invited in is so perfectly indicative of how personal it feels to not be invited into these spaces even if it’s for the purpose of preservation of the art. I love folk music, but what a great director does is show you their perspective and I can feel how Coogler feels when he hears it with this movie. 

And the cherry on top of this insane movie is how religion plays into it all. I think this is a little more buried in the text, but it is called Sinners and opens with a church so it was on my mind. In the climax when Sammie defaults to the Lord’s Prayer and the vampire starts reciting it too, something really clicked for me. Something about how organized religion is the original monoculture, forced upon people and now so deeply rooted that separating it from current culture is almost impossible. Sammie isn’t just fighting the idea of mainstream music and people trying to bite his lived-in style, he’s fighting his father who has religious expectations and sees his creativity as an obstacle stopping Sammie from being Godly. It’s a brilliant opening because of the vibe of that first scene, seeing Sammie go back home, my immediate thought was “oh look what the nightlife did to this boy” and after seeing the movie you know how important that night of playing was to him, how it wasn’t the club that destroyed him. 

This movie committing to the ending, having him clutch that guitar neck and drive away, it’s so powerful. The best thing we can do in this world is be true to our creativity, and this movie is all about that idea. Not to mention the loving eye this movie puts on the brief period where the brothers owned their own profitable business and gave their people a safe space to celebrate their culture, that really got to me. I believe the title, Sinners, refers to the creatives who reject any sort of monoculture and truly seek the unique, the art that could only come from them and their background, and it’s so brilliant because that’s what this movie is. Fully unique and only possible through the lens of the creative force behind it. Coogler is Iron Chef level cooking with this, arguing that being an artist/sinner is better than being a boring saint. 

Thematic poetic waxing aside, this movie just absolutely fucks. It’s so sexy and entertaining, I couldn’t take my eyes off it. It has some WILD dialogue but these actors sell the hell out of it, especially Hailee who has a really tough role with some insanely explicit lines that she sells so well. And with all these amazing and lived-in characters, this movie is not precious about keeping them alive or from turning. The build-up to the vamps getting invited in was so damn good, I was in tears when the shopkeeper screamed it out. And that shot of everyone grabbing weapons while the vampires  open that giant barn door, I swear you could have punched me in the fucking face and I wouldn’t have stopped watching. The swiftness with which that scene devolves into just death and massacre and violence is what a good climax is all about. Even if you’re not paying attention to the themes, this is a fully satisfying vampire horror extravaganza. 

I’m going to wrap this up, but I need to highlight how rare it is to really earn an ending like Michael B. Jordan mowing down racists. Like, it’s such a tropey blaxploitation revenge moment, but it feels amazing with those guitar riffs and with everything leading up. In maybe this movie's most brilliant turn, the vampires aren’t even the most evil characters. At least they offer some semblance of a life, and I really don’t think this movie damns the vampires fully as much as sees them as a naturally occurring obstacle to overcome in order to keep cultural identity unique. No, the real villains of this movie are the Klan racists, and it can be argued that the most convincing argument the vampires make for assimilation is how the racists were going to kill everyone anyways. Why not join mainstream culture and go on to turn the racists into vamps as well? So it feels earned and oh so right when the racists show up for the final scene and get what’s coming from an angry Jordan who had lost everything except his guns.

This movie rocks but the ending plus the mid-credits scene blast this off into undeniably incredible territory. It sees the vampires with such empathy, in a way, and there’s real literary value in how the only survivors of the night are the artist and the entrepreneur, and how Smoke had to overpower his vamp brother in order to get them to leave Sammie alone. This is a movie that will be talked about and thought about for years and years, and I for one can’t wait to rewatch it a million times. Like I said, 10/10.

The most impactful we could think of was Game of Thrones, and it's a TV show (and based on a book). The only movie I can really think of is maybe Get Out.

Movies just don't seem to be the cultural juggernaut they used to be. The issue might be exasperated by entertainment on social media.

Of the 23 movies with a production budget above 100 million: 

3 of them are originals:

* Better Man
* If 
* Megalopolis

Plus 2 more that are arguably originals:

* Fall Guy - Wikipedia says it is loosely based off of a TV show, I'm not sure how loosely
* Argylle - Standalone spinoff from Kingsman (I haven't seen it, so I don't know how much of a spinoff it is)

  
Of the 3 originals - 2 out of the three were independently funded. Better Man opened with the first 5 minutes being a long list of studios who all kicked in a bit of cash (allegedly Robbie put a ton of sweat equity in it too - He was doing private concerts and company holiday parties for the funding studios). Coppola sold his winery to fund Megalopolis - damned shame, since his wine was far better than the movie. 



All three flopped. With 2 out of the three on the list of biggest flops of all time. Hell, I genuinely think Megalopolis and Better Man might be the #1 and #2 flops on the all time flops list.

Sinners movie,“Just make good original movies”.,reddit,"Yes, this is the problem. Unfortunately, it's not simply a matter of ""make good movies"". If a movie doesn't feel like an event, people generally don't go anymore. Part of it is the short theatrical window and movies being available on streaming within 2 months or so. 

People are saying ""but audiences don't like those movies as much as critics"", but in the cases of the movies you mentioned, the audience scores are still good or very good. They might be lower than critics' scores but not by much. Like Mickey 17 is 78/73 and Companion is 95/89. The only one that is significantly different is Black Bag, and even then the 71% from audiences isn't terrible (although for an audience score, yes, that is low).

Every movie can't be a stone-cold classic. If the solution is to put out an absolute masterpiece that appeals to critics and audiences almost every week, then it's doomed. That's never been the case. Movies like Black Bag and Novocaine used to do perfectly well, even if audiences didn't fall in love with them.

The problem is what do we do? If studios just give up (which would be understandable) and just not put out mid-budget and original movies like these, then that's all there is to it.

They wanted you to think these two things were completely different, and how could you ever really compare them. It's interesting to go back and read about this era. Hollywood participated in a crazy targeted campaign to fight TV tooth and nail. As a result...two industries! Then later the studios bought the networks and the telecommunications companies bought the studios, but that's getting ahead of ourselves.

The movie industry had previously gone out of their way to separate film and keep it special rather than letting the more convenient industry take over their product. I'd say the biggest difference here is that because every studio tried to start its own streaming service, it was marketing to YOU the consumer that you could get the same experience at home that you could get in theaters. The same company that was trying to get you to the cinema was also trying to get you to stay home. They needed to justify their gigantic spend for streaming, so they sold that to audiences and stopped selling something special on the big screen. Max goes Day in Date. Lucasfilm frequently sold Mandalorian as ""Star Wars movie quality every week."" 20th Century releases movies like Prey direct to Hulu. They were trying to shift the industry, consciously, to streaming. It wasn't just that audiences CHOSE streaming. The studios SOLD streaming.

Well...

...it's bit them in the ass now because their streaming services are all colossally failing and they've devalued the only reliable money maker they had left - the theater. I also think Hollywood really underestimated how bad of a product a single MOVIE is in the digital marketplace. Like if you think about it as a product, the internet is the last place you should sell it. It requires effort and attention to engage with it. A very rewarding product in the theater or as the singular movie you and your family have spent money to rent for the evening. That system rewarded what the product was and kept it special. As one of a million option tiles that pop up on a streaming service…less appealing. 

The system could've worked. Netflix licenses the studio’s product and two industries emerge: Theatrical and Digital Streaming Distributors (like netflix) with a studio mandated PVOD window to duplicate the second run market of DVDs. Streaming becomes the new TNT/HBO syndication of movies, and everything else is Blockbuster online. 

Instead they tried to compete with Netflix as a studio on Netflix's home turf. They lost!",0.061,0.848,0.091,0.9412,Positive,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

It’s better to consider this as more of a character study of the twins and Sammie, as well a look at the influence of the blues on black culture.

As for your complaint about it being “cliched” that the vampires were a bunch of evil white people, that’s the thematic crux of the movie. On the surface, Sinners is a movie about vampires. But metaphorically, it’s about cultural appropriation and assimilation.

The vampires force their mainly black victims to become one with them, which isn’t entirely dissimilar to what happened to black people when they interacted with white people in the past (and in the present). The vampires seem to be enthralled by Black culture and music, but they still effectively kill most of them just so they can have them under their thumb and take advantage of the things they like about them.

Sinners movie,Sinners was not a good movie,reddit,"I guess I felt like this movie felt unfocused from my perspective. I felt like everything up until the juke was character focused. 

Whereas I felt like once they got to the sawmill, the film became much more experiential and emotional. Enjoy the music. Enjoy the shots. 

But when the vampires showed up, I felt like both of those aspects took a backseat. The climax in particular just kind of felt like they decided it was time for the movie to end. I didn’t feel like I really got endings to each  of the characters in a way that felt set up by the beginning of the film. 

I think any of those vibes would have made a good movie, I just didn’t understand why each of them existed together. They felt at tension with each other. 

I feel like the film also lacks tension because we know how it’s all going to end because it’s how the movie starts. The main character seems to be the only one to survive. So there’s little dramatic tension in who will/wont escape. 

Then you add in the showdown with the KKK, which didn’t feel especially well motivated from a character perspective. And then add on it the odd mid-credits sequence where the characters hug. It just kind of feels all over the place. The vampires don’t seem to be purely evil like they’d been implied to be. Maybe there’s some lesson or theme there, but I felt unaware of it.

Sinners movie,Sinners was not a good movie,reddit,"I feel like most of these are pretty straightforward no? The main vampire was getting burned as the sun went down and we can assume/imagine he was in the shade or something prior to find the racist cabin.

The super strength part is a legitimate point though imo. They aren’t too consistent with their strength and the vampires get nerfed as the movie goes on. Especially when they get through the doors and our surviving crew has a “Hold the Line” moment where realistically only Smoke could fight them but there were so many he should have been overrun. 

No idea how the holy water works lol. I’m assuming the water didn’t become holy cause it didn’t meet all the requirements? Idk.

I see the last point as if the main vampire gets injured they can all feel it but won’t actually die. Everyone except Mary and Stack burned because they were in the sun, but Mary and Stack were shown to leave earlier alluding to they made it out before the sun came up.

Sinners movie,Sinners was not a good movie,reddit,"I appreciate your response, but, yeah see, that’s kind of the problem. You said most of those points were ""straightforward,"" but then couldn’t actually explain them with anything solid. Saying “we can assume” or “maybe this” or “I’m guessing that” isn’t the same as giving an actual explanation. That’s exactly what I was getting at, the movie makes up its own lore, breaks it, and never gives us anything to work with. If it really was that straightforward, there shouldn’t be this many “idks” in your explanation.

Also, just to respond to some of your comments, why did the main vampire instantly disintegrate when the sun came up, but not when he was first introduced in full sunlight? That wasn’t shade, he was standing in a full beam of light. And as far as I know, saying a prayer over a body of water is literally what makes it holy water, so that moment made no sense either.

And, if all the vampires can feel the pain of the main one, it strongly implies they’re connected which is why, in most vampire lore, killing the master kills the offspring. That’s what made that whole sequence feel like it was setting that up... but then Stack and the love interest just walk away fine? If it didnt work that way then why add it to the film, twice - when he was hit by the guitar and the stake through the heart.

Also, you’re saying we shouldn’t focus on the inconsistencies, but the inconsistencies are part of the movie. That stuff matters, especially when the film leans on vampire lore to drive the plot.

Sinners movie,Sinners was not a good movie,reddit,"Very late to the discussion. For context, I’m a black woman who went into the movie expecting it to be amazing because it’s been hyped to be amazing. I love period pieces, I love movies that explore race, and I love horror—it’s my favorite genre. 

I was really confused about how and why this movie got the hype it did. It was entertaining, but as you said, the plot was incredibly weak. Way too much time was spent on them running around getting stuff for the event that night. Way too much complexity was added in places where it wasn’t necessary. 

For example, Mary. Very rich potential there—a woman who lives as a white woman while openly having black ancestry and associating with black people. How did she get there? That would be an unusual life at that time—plenty of people “passed” as white, but they did so secretly and did not associate with black people to avoid blowing their cover, since “passing” was a serious offense with deadly consequences (read The Vanishing Half, a great novel on the topic). So how is Mary married to a white man, passing between white and black spaces, openly associating with black people and having a past sexual relationship with a black man? Yelling in the streets about their sex life? Those things weren’t acceptable then and we are given zero backstory as to how Mary is managing this double life.

And then there’s Sammie’s music. This supernatural music is super cool and they touch on it in the beginning, then bring it back and explain it more fully right before the conflict with the vampires begin, and then…. That’s it! That’s the last of Sammie’s magical music. I thought the music was going to be more important to the story and was extremely confused when nothing really played out with that (eg Sammie using his music to overcome the vampires). 

Instead of showing the twins running around preparing for the party, they should have fleshed out Sammie’s abilities more, or more clearly explained where the vampires came from and why they wanted Sammie. Or if the twins were the focus, make them the focus and have it be about their battle with the vampires without the extra unnecessary, mystical details about other characters",0.059,0.816,0.126,0.9837,Positive,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

Sinners movie,Sinners was not a good movie,reddit,"I think you missed something really important about Remmick, the master vampire. He's specifically an Irish immigrant because of how Irish people were and now are treated in the United States.

During the waves of Irish immigration into America, the Irish were treated pretty terribly. Quite a few articles from that time effectively call them 'white black people' but a lot less kindly. By the 1930s though when the movie took place, that sentiment was dying down and the descendants of the original Irish immigrants were assimilating into 'white American' culture. In the process, they lost quite a bit of their own. 

If you've been to the northeast part of the US, there's still lots of Americans who consider themselves 'Irish' and would describe their culture as 'Irish'. But as someone who's lived both in New England and Ireland, what is presented as Irish culture in the US lacks the actual connections to Irish history by this point. They legitimately enjoy their practices, but they're not 'Irish practices' anymore. They've been assimilated into white society, and in that there's some indescribable soul that's been lost.

Now back to Remmick, a man who's looking for a culture he remembers and has lost. He comes upon a group of people who remind him of his own, and a people he knows are going to be targeted and killed the next day. In his mind, he is saving them while regaining the community he lost. But when he turns the black people from the juke, they lose a part of themselves. They all function as one being, and are happy, but they've lost their ability to connect with their ancestors. The same way that the previous English and German immigrants assimilated the Irish, this Irish man is assimilating this community of black people. 

To make it personal for a minute, I'm American with Irish and Pontic heritage and grew up mainly in New England. Lots of modern day people from that area have Irish ancestry and call themselves Irish-Americans, but hold different values than the Irish people I met while living in Ireland. And, they're kinda racist. I got a lot of shit growing up for having a 'strange' last name and not being pale as fuck. 

Remmick and his turning people is less a call against white people, and more a call against assimilation and color blindness. Communities are developed and maintained through celebrating who we are, where we've come from, and freely sharing that with others. Pushing everyone into 'sameness' in order to be unified is the threat that Remmick brings to the story.",0.097,0.807,0.096,-0.3514,Negative,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Sinners movie,Sinners was not a good movie,reddit,"Yeah dude, I'd really recommend you take another watch when it comes out on streaming. There's a lot of little details that build the plot. It's very much what's called 'soft worldbuilding'; things are given in terms of references and unspoken details more than an in your face way of pushing the plot forward.

A great example of this is when the twins buy the mill from the KKK dude at the beginning. One of them comments about the floors being freshly washed and asks the guy why they washed the floors. The KKK guy doesn't give a real answer of just spits some tobacco on the floor. But from the end of the movie you can get the idea that the mill was used by the local KKK to kill people in the past. It's never something said, but can be put together from tiny bits of dialogue and looks through the movie. It's why the mill is referred to as a slaughterhouse by multiple people.

Another tiny example is the Choctaw. There's a very specific reason he picked them besides that they lived in Mississippi and Alabama before being forcefully relocated to Oklahoma. During the Great Famine when the Irish were starved, the Choctaw sent a donation of about $5000 in today's money to the people of Ireland. The Choctaw had just barely survived the Trail of Tears themselves, and yet they gave everything they could to these people they had never met. To this day there's close connections between the Choctaw nation and Ireland. Kennick is the only person who refers to the people hunting him as Choctaw, by their name. The two racists he cons into letting him in just call them Indians. He shows them a level of respect that would not be common during this time period, even though they're trying to kill him.

Another bit I noticed is when Sammie, Stack, and Delta Slim are driving back and Slim is telling the story of a friend who got lynched over having too much money on him and trying to make a better life for himself. The amount his friend had was $12,000. In 2022 Coogler was briefly arrested at a bank for trying to withdraw $12,000 of his own money from his account, because the teller thought he was a robber.

Coogler did some great historical research with this film. There's a lot of little details that help make the story that may not be noticed the first time. The only reason I know some of the history stuff myself is my father-in-law is a history buff who's part native.

\- Native Americans hunting down the vampire.  They were never heard or seen from again, not even after sunrise.

\- The inclusion of the ex-KKK, it had zero impact on the story.  In fact, it felt like the shootout was injected by a producer because they felt there wasn't enough action.

Half the people that think it was great wouldn’t have thought that if there wasn’t so much hype around it. The only good parts were the cinematography and the cast and all that requires is a fucking good budget. They got everyone to go watch it by throwing in big name actors (Micheal B) and inflating others (Ryan Coogler (a name most ppl never heard of until they mentioned him around this movie. Now everyone’s acting like he’s fuckin Christopher Nolan and that they’ve been known the guy. no hate to him though.) 

To those who are going to respond with all the historical relevance and all the easter eggs my response is: I shouldn’t have to do/read a fucking history research project after watching a movie to understand it and enjoy it.

Acting was good, cinematography was great, but the PLOT was not clear up until the 2nd act. The first act dragged like a mf. The movie is advertised as Horror/Adventure. There was NO HORROR up until the last 30 minutes. The adventure ? I wasn’t quite interested in it because of how much it was dragging. Didn’t really feel like a journey, just a bunch of world building and side characters with hardly any payoff at the end. 

Don’t get me started on that dam “otherworldly connection” breakdance/twerk scene. I was cracking tf up when I saw that. Also, what the hell was up with MBJ getting it on with someone who looks like she could be his mom? Not a very attractive sex scene if u ask me but hey to each his own. 

The film was just underwhelming. Definitely not a 98% or 10/10 rating that’s just absurd. The themes and cultural significance weren’t enough to keep me entertained. We criticize other movies when the plot doesn’t make much sense, the film drags on way too long before getting to the climax, &amp; when they don’t deliver on the genre’s they’re advertised to be (HORROR/ADVENTURE).

The plot for any movie is pretty easy to make out. And you don't need to know the entirety of the plot before you see the actual movie. That spoils a lot of the surprise. The Irish vampire was not even an overly evil character, he was heavily implied to want to share eternal life and music with the main cast. 

The Irish music numbers were actually really good, I think it was great music in those scenes as well

The KKK members were obviously bad. But they didn't stay racists when they became vampires, they were wholly different. Idk, I get that a lot of white characters were bad in this, but the movie is set in the south in a time where lots of white southerners were persecuting minorites. The bad white people were all depicted as being KKK affiliated. Do we want to ignore those kinds of people exist so that modern white audiences are more comfortable? Also Hailee Steinfeld was the hottie of the movie, and as a vampire she too was shown to be more interested in converting her friends than killing them.

Them showing up at the door to look for Remmick was a genuine attempt at stopping that from happening again as the vicious cycle continues.

Sinners movie,Sinners was not a good movie,reddit,"I think saying that the vampires were ""just evil white people"" is doing it a massive disservice, tbh. Racism is the background of the movie, considering the setting, but I wouldn't consider it a theme at all the movie was looking to focus on.




What I got out of it was more about how the oppressed can find their freedom and voice, their happiness and community. Because of the setting, that can LOOK a lot like a theme around racism, but the master vampire was from another very oppressed minority from America's history, and to me it seemed like the purpose for that was to show the parallel between the struggles his people(the irish) had faced, and the struggles the African American population faced in the south. To show that it isn't necessarily a race thing, and it isn't necessarily an ""us vs the oppressors"" thing, it's about how you keep ahold of your culture and how it is expressed while also trying to find a sense of safety and community.




It's absolutely fine if the movie wasn't for you(and I agree that the plot feels like the weakest part of the movie), but I really just don't love the argument that it's a ""Ope, classic White people vs Black people themes"" kind of movie.",0.134,0.743,0.123,-0.5903,Negative,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Sinners movie,Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' - Review Thread,reddit,"I just came home from watching Sinners and honestly i was really proud by what he chose to focus on. We didn't get slave porn, or trauma porn. 

We got characters who a had agency, had great juicy roles from everyone. We got a post credit scene. We got a script with really good writing, afro surrealism, and a camera that worked hard to give exposition instead of just talking the audience to death with lore.

It was beautiful I think I may have cried twice. And it had alot of room to breath for a film that felt like it only really had one plot going on. It felt long despite being a short enough story with a strong buildup so that we love and see every character fleshed out.

We got a celebration of music and dance from several cultures, we were shown appreciation through participation. We had black people, African people, black American futures, asian people, indian people, and even white/european dancing and singing and pulling from all cultures.

This wasn't really a film about hate between races in fact I think this was more a film about unification despite differences, until the very end we were reminded that the only real enemies are the ones that commit genocide like the Klan.

I think at the end of the day ignoring the beautiful spectacle it had great messages and the music was even better. It really smartly laid down their scoring to every dialogue so that there is a baseline of emotion throughout the entire script. You can hear the crowd lynching someone at the train station as he tells a story from memory. Another great exposition is without being told the location of their hometown we understand it's segregated without having to focus on segregation. We get one fantastic sequence of an Asian family who either works or owns two separate markets one for colored people and one for white people

The white vamps had their own thing going and were actually sharing it in some ways as well...like blues and bluegrass, etc were actually all from the same well. I was waiting the whole time for the white people to be the enemy to be conquered but when the head white vampire literally tipped them off to the plans of the Klan and it ended up being true, my thoughts on that shifted as well.

Sinners movie,Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' - Review Thread,reddit,"Just watching this film, excuse the lateness. The head white vamp was Irish. At first I thought it was weird that the vamp wasn't British and representing colonialism, but then in the scene where he joins Sammie in reciting the Bible verse, I believe it was, he basically says a line that tells how his people were subjugated by the same oppressive hand (the church) and he came to know it was a comfort. The Irish have a similar history to many black cultures around the world in that they were also colonised by the crown. The start of the film ties African and Celtic culture together as having powerful art that traces back through time, or their own cultural narrative (specifically music history) that another culture wants to steal/exploit. These settled countries are perfect for these stories as the Irish were often shipped there (e.g. Australia) as criminals and suffered similarly poor treatment as the indigenous people. So the head Celtic having them all perform a jig was more representing his deep cultural ties to his people and trying to show the black people that assimilating into white culture and sharing their rich unique history was the way to immortality (vampires represent this), but really was ""selling the soul"" of black people, and the vampires were all those that had turned to the temptation offered by white cultural vampires, or had their hand forced. I loved the idea that music is storytelling art across time and that there were deep cultural roots for the different characters that the church was actually pulling them from. The church was flipped here, and was not salvation from evil, the vampires actually represented its end product, a shared cultural narrative to the exclusion of all others. Here the church is salvation forced upon a culture from the other that took it in the first place. It is the olive branch gifted from the same tree that collapsed onto their home",0.083,0.803,0.114,0.929,Positive,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

Sinners movie,Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' - Review Thread,reddit,"The scene where Remmick recites the Lord’s Prayer with Sammie reinforces this take. 

Remmick tells Sammie that the men who took his father’s land brought the Lord’s Prayer with them, which is a reference to the Christianization of Ireland. Irish-Gaelic culture was assimilated to fit into Christian faith, with their history, lore and gods being twisted to fit with church doctrine. So while it was preserved in a sense, it would never be what it once was. 

Remmick is also an agent of assimilation; he can’t add to culture or create it, he can preserve it in a sense thru the memories of his victims but is cut off from participation. The Irish Jig he does, great as it was, resembles more a robotic imitation of a human dance with how perfectly choreographed it was, in contrast to the more vibrant, messy music and dance in the hall. He craves culture and community but can only create more hungry thralls like himself. 

This might also play into Sammie’s choice to leave his father’s church at the end. He could have chosen the safety of his father and life as a preacher, rejecting music. But instead I think part of him saw he would just be assimilating into another unchanging collective instead of living. So he rejected that and chose to strike out on his own.",0.075,0.786,0.139,0.9562,Positive,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
Sinners movie,Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' - Review Thread,reddit,"Was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of Sinners on a full fledged IMAX screen this week. This movie is as good, as substantive, as cinematic as the early reviews suggest. The film somehow manages to infuse the vampire movie framework with layers you don't typically get from it (joy, musicality, reverie) alongside layers you absolutely expect from it (thrill, sorrow, tension). It's a got a sequence in the mid-2nd-act that I'm still thinking about two days later. Is the writing a bit overloaded and jumbled in spots? Yes. But even these flaws are counter balanced with a palpable passion and thoughtfulness too rarely seen in this scale of filmmaking. I haven't even really touched on the movie from a technical and craft perspective yet. Suffice to say, every department is working at the top of their games. The IMAX 65mm and Ultra Panavision 70 cinematography is stunning. Really, really, recommend people see this movie in the theaters, in IMAX, if possible.

Stack leaves Sammie alive and keeps his promise, which to me means he can make his own choices, and can actively choose to do the right thing at any given time. So why was he trying to kill his brother? I guess maybe while Remmick was still “alive”, Stack was under the control of the hive-mind and then gained autonomy after Remmick’s death? Mary seemed genuinely upset about Annie being killed, which means she had her wits about her too? So why’d she bite Smoke? My only head-canon is that Remmick’s influence over them kind of forced them. Evident by the singing in unison. Damn. Stack should’ve turned. Could’ve ran with his brother for a millennia.

Sinners movie,Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' - Review Thread,reddit,"The kind of film where you know the movie gods were right beside them as they were making it.

Ryan Coogler's films deal with the struggle of identity within a system trying to suppress you. Whether it's Oscar Grant trying to become a better version of himself in Fruitvale Station, Adonis Creed wrestling with his father’s legacy to create an identity of his own, or King T'Challa struggling with his role as a king—balancing tradition and duty with the need to make reparations for the past and forge a new path forward.
Ultimately, Coogler's films are about what it means to live as a person in a world that won’t let you—and how power, history, and love collide in that pursuit. Sinners, in that regard, might be his biggest and best culmination of that yet.

Set in Jim Crow–era Mississippi, it’s about two brothers returning home and trying to start over, only to be confronted by an even bigger evil—the supernatural kind.

Sinners, while it will be marketed as a Michael B. Jordan movie, is really the story of a young kid named Sammie (played brilliantly by debutant Miles Caton). It’s through Sammie and his music that we become part of this world. His blues isn’t a form of entertainment—it’s a form of self-expression and spiritual awakening that pushes back against those who seek to exploit him.

The film sheds light on how Black art—especially music—is co-opted, commodified, and stripped of its cultural roots for white profit and pleasure. Through Sammie’s music, we hear echoes of resilience, sorrow, and survival. His music becomes an archive of history, and through it, he manages to create an identity of his own.",0.042,0.847,0.111,0.9732,Positive,0,1,1,0,1,0,0

Stories that promote traditional Chinese culture is encouraged. 

I think the fact that many aspects of Dios de los Muertos is similar to the traditional Chinese holiday Qingming made the movie’s premise more palatable to Chinese censors than other movies about ghosts. For Qingming people also place offerings to ancestors at altars and visit their ancestors’ graves. Mexican practices to honouring ancestors is very similar to Chinese cultural practices.

For every original film that takes a risk and succeeds, at least one filmmaker will be given a blank check for a while and also gain the cachet to produce original movies from lesser known directors.",0.038,0.699,0.263,0.987,Positive,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I have to agree.

Sinners' success is great for Ryan Coogler and Michael B Jordan.

Sinners' and Nosferatu's success is great for the vampire section of the horror genre.

But I can't see either of these two movies moving any grand goalposts for moviemaking when it comes to any bigger picture in Hollywood.

Sinners movie,28 Years Later: The Bone Temple - Review Thread,reddit,"I don’t think violence and brutality was dealt with that intelligently here, and for me that was a major selling point for the series. In 28YL, violence, loss and death in post-Rage Britain are presented as grim and tragic, in Days the parallels between the infected and non-infected are handled deftly, but this time there was a lot of sensationalisation/titillation going on. For a film where “Memento Mori, but remember you were loved” Kelson was arguably the protagonist (Fiennes was fantastic), this jarred with me. On top of that there was some“I’m gonna show the full gory reality of this violent world”which isnt my cup of tea. I wasn’t surprised by DaCosta saying in her AMA that she’d love to direct the live action version of Invincible.

The soldier section of Days was comparable but Days couldn’t have worked with that alone, and the characterisation of the soldiers was just way better than that of the Jimmies (who were in the entire film) tbh.

I also wasn’t convinced by some of the science and felt the idea the infected were seeing non-infected how non-infected see infected needed a bit more work, as we’ve spent the previous films being shown it’s uncontrollable rage. With this logic, &gt;!presumably the infected began to see Samson as a threat when he spoke, which…what happened there, biologically…unless the antipsychotics actually cured the infection AND left Samson immune/a carrier - their attack on him would have reinfected him otherwise - why would the infected brain start to see him as a threat?!&lt;.",0.193,0.716,0.091,-0.9846,Negative,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Sinners movie,28 Years Later: The Bone Temple - Review Thread,reddit,"One of the most telling moments in Bone Temple is the brief POV shot from an infected, where we see how the uninfected are perceived. It suggests that the rage is not just loss of control, but a distortion of perception itself.

When the film later frames the infection as involving brain hemorrhaging and psychosis, that shot starts to read as a clue. The infected are not simply violent. They are seeing the world incorrectly.

Jimmy’s upside down crucifixion echoes this idea. When the perspective shifts to his POV and Sampson appears with horns, the parallel becomes clear. Jimmy is not infected, yet his perception breaks in the same way. Under extreme trauma, he no longer sees a man, but a symbolic figure shaped by his own beliefs.

What’s interesting is that Jimmy’s vision is religious in form despite his anti religious worldview. It suggests that his way of understanding the world is not fundamentally different from the infected, only filtered through a different lens.

The issue wasn’t “the shoes were too big, no one will ever be him again”, it was that filming for BP2 started 6 months after he passed, and the people in charge decided it was too soon to recast him - practically, on a personal level (a lot of the crew were very close with Chadwick - some found it so hard they didn’t come back for BP2 without him), and on a PR level - if they’d recast him that soon the about of “how utterly disrespectful to his memory, he’s been gone a couple of months and they’re replacing him, everyone’s clearly just a commodity to Disney” coverage would have been worse for coverage than the anti Brie coverage was for the marvels.

I do agree on Shuri though. IMO, she’s the least interesting wakandan character by a sizable margin, it genuinely felt like she was just characterised as “young enough that everyone underestimates her so she can turn around and out science people like Stark”.

Personally, I’d like to have shifted from it being a black panther film to a wakanda films and focused on the Dora Milaje, or, and this is my personal preference, a spy thriller focused on Nakia.",0.068,0.837,0.095,0.7481,Positive,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

(I interpreted them as Scots Irish based on the Wild Mountain Thyme song, which is recognisably Scottish based on the lyrics, and the fact they are Klan members which is militantly Protestant and anti-Catholic).

Scots Irish people would not have considered themselves Irish. They are the descendants of Scottish colonial settlers who undertook the plantation of Ulster. This is when the British crown transferred land ownership from the native Catholic Irish population to a colonial Protestant Scottish population. Laws were put in place to prevent Catholics owning land and a systemic attempt was made to eradicate the Irish language and culture. This has present day ramifications in the existence of Northern Ireland, where there remains a cultural divide between mostly Protestants who would describe themselves as British, and mostly Catholics who would describe themselves as Irish (this divide has become less pronounced in recent years). 

Obviously, that’s not to say Irish Catholics didn’t go on to be racist in America, but in this situation I felt the film made them Scots Irish to accentuate an attempting to draw a commonality between people of Irish and West African descent, both in their history but also their musical culture.",0.012,0.978,0.01,-0.3182,Negative,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

Sinners movie,"Ryan Coogler channeled the things that terrify him into his new movie, “Sinners,” by David Sims",reddit,"The director of *Sinners* knew that it was time to break out of his comfort zone, David Sims writes.⁠

Ryan Coogler has made five movies, all of them well-received hits—especially *Black* *Panther* and its sequel, which became a cultural phenomenon and a high-water mark for Marvel. *Sinners*, a strange, heady piece of horror set in the Jim Crow Deep South, is his first entirely original work. He tells Sims that the film “came from a place inside of myself I wasn’t sure existed.”⁠

⁠“I got afraid, bro,” Coogler said. “Because when you’re working with other things, there’s also something to hide behind a little bit. It takes quite a bit of the pressure off. And the reality is, you’re less exposed if somebody doesn’t like it.” He continued: “I didn’t want to get caught up in the comfort of not being fully exposed. I didn’t want to look back at myself and say, ‘Man, I was chickenshit.’ So I went for it with this one.”⁠

Coogler called *Sinners* a love letter to a blues-obsessed uncle from Mississippi, and wanted the film to “feel like you were reading ‘Salem’s Lot’ while listening to the best blues record.”⁠

“This music is maybe our country’s greatest homegrown contribution. I had no idea of the epic nature of what was made in this place at this time,” Coogler said, “that became global pop culture. That was just flat-out astonishing, to think that these people that weren’t even considered full human beings by the state could make an art form that’s such a lightning rod.”⁠

Coogler had faced doubts when making *Black* *Panther*, among them that a film with a predominantly Black cast wouldn’t do well overseas. “That brings this full circle—like, the music made by a Black sharecropper with a guitar,” he told Sims. “How am I going to take that to Sweden? But there you have it. Everything you’re saying is true, and I believe in the value of the media. I don’t think it goes away. I pray it doesn’t. I love walking into a dark room with a bunch of strangers and a trailer rolling. The movie starts, and shit gets weird, and you hear people react to it. I love that feeling.”⁠⁠
