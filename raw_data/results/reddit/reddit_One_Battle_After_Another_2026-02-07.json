        "Things that have happened so far while I’ve been reading a Pynchon book about 18th century land surveying:\n\n- Talking dog\n\n- Wizards who can fly (casually revealed one of the main characters is one after like 400 pages)\n\n- The Catholic Church having a system of giant electric billboards on hot air balloons to communicate over long distances\n\n- An intelligent robotic duck that can fly across oceans and vibrate so fast it turns invisible; the duck has an enemies to lovers plot with France’s best duck cooking chef.\n\n- China is a different planet that smooshed into Earth and Chinese people might technically be extraterrestrials",
        "Someone once described FLCL as being what you'd get if Hideaki Anno and Thomas Pynchon wrote an anime together, and having read a few of his novels and watched Evangelion....yeah I can see it.",

        "I mean it’s made 150m already it’s not really bombing, it just cost 180m to make is the problem",
        "I wonder how much of the budget went on salaries. I know that Leo takes $25 mil usually, so my guess is that actors demanding so much money has more to do with budgets ballooning past $100 mil and not turning a profit at the box office once you add marketing into the equation.",
        "The thing with Leo's salary is that this movie wouldn't have made over $100m if he wasn't a part of it. For other actors, we can have that debate, but he draws the overseas crowds that are generating most of the box office. I can't imagine the other actors demanding the 8 figures he does",
        "Considering there will be blood was a budget of 25m I have no idea why it’s so different",
        "Minecraft had a practically unlimited budget because the studio knew it would earn approximately a Morbillion dollars",
        "Minecraft 2 will earn roughly a tronzillion dollars",
        "The conomy of 2027 depends on Minecraft 2 being a smash hit.",
        "i'm so confused. did they think there was a big enough target audience out there to make 350+ million to break even ? there seems to be only like 4 movies each year that make that kind of money. and they were hoping to be one of them ?",
        "I honestly don't think they expected to break even, Paul Thomas Anderson movies don't tend to score too well on the box office, but come awards season I'd be surprised if it doesn't sweep up a fair few, this is definitely a prestige picture! (Personally I thought it was great)",
        "Yeah, to put this into perspective, there have been **two** confirmed PTA box office successes. Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood, maybe Phantom Thread broke into the black but if so just barely. And even then, TWBB only grossed $76million. \n\nBut WB gave a guy who’s batting 2/9 for turning a profit an original film with a $175million budget. There’s no way Warner Brothers was expecting that money back. According to their own projections, the movie’s box office was on-target for its first two weeks. \n\nAnd that seems to be what WB were expecting by their screening strategy: keep it in theaters as long as possible to generate word-of-mouth buzz (PTA films have a long history of poor debuts). Try to keep it in theaters when other Oscar movies start appearing, and do another set of screening come awards season (where it will get a ton of attention). That will mitigate some of the damage.",
        "It’s also adds value to their library permanently. It’s not a piece of IP drivel no one will watch in 10 years. They’ll be able to extract money from it as long as movies are a thing.",
        "I think they were banking more on Leo drawing people to theaters than Paul Thomas Anderson.",
        "And usually movies that win big at the Oscars tend to have a surge in views after that, because people that were out of the loop will look at the list of winners and watch those films out of curiosity.",
        "The purpose of every movie isn’t to be a blockbuster, PTA has been trying to make OBAA for over a decade",
        "Correct. That's what Minecraft is for, so they can spend money on stuff like OBAA",
        "One chicken jockey after another",
        "Movies cost too much to make, too much to market, too much to go see and streaming services keep getting more expensive to subscribe to. \n\nOther than that, the film industry is in great shape.",
        "I still enjoy going to the movies, but the cost means I'm really not going to go unless its something I really want to see. The cost has entirely killed the concept of going to the movies just because you have some time to kill or just want to check out a movie that someone said you might like.",
        "Yeah, I totally agree. When it was 8 bucks, it was a perfect way to spend a couple hours. Now that it's 3x that much, it's harder for me to want to spend the money. \nThis is less about the industry and more about my personal situation, but the closest theater that isn't falling apart is 35 minutes away, which definitely doesn't help to entice me.",
        "There's a theater near me with a bar inside. After I walked in I had a little time to kill and thought it would be nice to have a cocktail whilebI waited. The drink was $16.",
        "That's just the cost of cocktails now.",
        "Anora cost to make: $6m\n\nAnora cost to market for Oscars: $18m\n\nYeah, shit is outta hand. Anora was insanely good IMO but the fact that it was more than 3x the cost of the film to market it is fuckin nuts.",
        "Marketing cost isn't necessarily relative to production budget cost though. $18m is a fraction of what a movie like say Mickey 17 spent in marketing.",
        "&gt;Marketing cost isn't necessarily relative to production budget\n\nGood point. Commercial probably costs the same to film and spread regardless of if you spent 100k or 100m on the movie, so long as you are looking to reach a similar audience and a similar amount of people. Actually it might be a bit cheaper to make a trailer for a cheap movie but otherwise you should expect to pay a lot if you want a wide reach.",
        "Genuinely have no idea why it cost so much to make.",
        "For starters, DiCaprio has a flat rate of $20M or something like that.",
        "That salary isn't even crazy when you learn Jared Leto got paid $15 million to star in Tron: Ares.",
        "Leto was a producer as well",
        "I don't really understand why Jared Leto keeps getting paid so much when it seems like his presence in a movie tends to absolutely tank it. Are they still holding out for another Requiem for a Dream resurgence? What am I missing?",
        "\"Well, it does, because that amount is called my quote. That's my rate. So the next film I'm offered, they have to pay that same amount. Even if I do a bad job. That means, as long as I'm offered even one more movie, I could get two more mil. Even if I do a bad job, they've got to give me that other two mil.\"",
        "Hello shirt brother",
        "that amount is called his quote. that's his rate. even if he does a bad job, they gotta pay him that $20M",
        "If Leonardo DiCaprio was here, would you ask him about Christmases around the corner?",
        "This is why I prefer Corncob TV over big budget movies",
        "They said the movie is kind of a cosmic gumbo",
        "that’s still only 20 out of 130-175 million, i’m sure sean penn got a few million as well but none of the other actors would have a high salary. The movie looked less expensive than civil war which had a budget of 50 million so i feel like there was definitely some mismanagement here",
        "Don’t forget shooting on location in California on VistaVision film and cameras to be mastered in 35 and 70mm formats. Lots of stunts, vehicles, pyrotechnics, helicopters, background actors, rented military equipment. Even a scene as simple as DiCaprio talking on the phone outside of the grocery store, you have dozens of background drivers being directed by a few ADs, a wetdown of the entire parking lot, two camera dolly setups. You have to pay to rent a base camp for each day of shooting, catering/craft services, security, costuming, drivers. Not to mention you’re also paying to get roads or intersections either shut down or with guided traffic, you’re paying to shut down a business for a day to shoot (covering not just the cost of the space but potential revenue loss for the business day). Also, set decorating and changing signs of stores, renting police vehicles with custom Baktan Cross insignias…it adds up.",
        "They converted a ton of buildings in town to sets and remodeled the grocery store before filming so i know it cost a pretty penny our community was excited they were shooting in our small town.",
        "Civil War has more visual effects, which helps lend it a sense of scale, but if you look at what’s actually there onscreen, it’s clearly a smaller production. And then you add in that it was shot in Atlanta and the UK, both of which are cheaper to shoot in than California and have/had way more generous tax credits and it all starts adding up.",
        "[deleted]",
        "There's a reason why most movies don't shoot on location in California any more. \n\nCivil War shot on cheap cameras in Atlanta and London.",
        "1. Three big name actors at the top of the billing. Di Caprio alone was paid $20mil.\n\n2. Lots of helicopters.\n\n3. Shot mainly on location in California, not a cheap place to do anything, with a lot of scenes which would have required extensive road closures and permits.",
        "[deleted]",
        "Worth it",
        "Ocean waves.",
        "Absolutely worth it for the few small beers",
        "He was busy buying a few small beers.",
        "He had a few",
        "Vistavision camera use as well -- even if Giovanni was their go-to on it, i am sure processing needed to be done for film as well",
        "Considering how often the Vistavision theatres broke down maybe the actual camera broke down a lot too.",
        "Really? It was clearly a pretty huge production. That middle protest sequence was a full action set piece. All the location shooting in the first third couldn't have been cheap either.",
        "Yeah the scope of somw the scenes are huge. People think something is cheap because it isnt cgi. When in reality, staging these scenes forreal in real locations is more expensive",
        "It’s visible on the screen. It looks great, has huge stars, real locations, big stunts.",
        "The production values are hidden and not as obvious, for example just think about the graphics and photos in the walls of the Dojo. Everything is designed by an art department. \n\nThink about the crowd scenes (school dance, riots, people in the outdoor prisons) and all the costumes involved. \n\nAll the equipment that the militarized police had. Training involved. The movie had multiple car chases, in cities, in outskirts, etc. There were helicopters, stunts, and probably a whole slew of VFX for background and setting. \n\nA movie like this doesn’t get shot guerrilla style, it uses a lot of traditional labour and everything is meticulously planned.",
        "Yeah, people are really overstating the role that actor salaries had on this. The production costs must have been absolutely insane. A large majority of the budget is on the screen, not going to paying performers.",
        "DiCaprio",
        "I'm still convinced the biggest issue here is movies come to streaming services too quick. It feels like most movies are in the theaters 3-4 weeks and then streaming on the 5th week. They've trained people to just assume they can watch it next month at home.",
        "Literally no reason to take kids to see a movie in the theater anymore. They don’t understand movie opening dates and it’s no problem if they wait two months.",
        "Plus it’s exorbitantly expensive and the crowds suck ass.",
        "The crowds part doesn't get talked about enough – I saw this in a theatre that smelled like feet because the person behind me took their shoes off, and the person next to me ate a full meal and flossed afterwards (no, it was not an Alamo Drafthouse either)",
        "The people next to me in weapons were having a full on break up fight. My fiance said something and they acted like he was a monster. Meanwhile I went to a concert recently and some woman behind me kept freaking out that people were touching (aka grazing lightly) her… this was the pit. I don’t know how to prove it but these two things are somehow related.",
        "They stream early out of necessity to stay relevant.  Movie going culture declines with the rise of alternative forms of entertainment.  I wonder if there's surveys to back this up but so many people I know who would go to movies and talk about them just don't anymore.",
        "Exactly, same as most music. It's why so many artists release a constant stream of singles now, because if they take two years to work on an album it gets forgotten on everyone's social media feed within days unless it's a top level celebrity artist. Releasing all those songs weekly keeps people noticing and listening. Spending hundreds of millions on a movie that doesn't have all the momentum and marketing of a comic book film and hoping millions of people show up to an increasingly shitty and expensive experience is going to become an increasingly poor business plan.",
        "Seriously. I wanted to see it this week only to find out my closest theater stops playing it today. If you figure most of the buzz happens after the first week of release, that's only 2 weeks for people to plan to see the movie.\n\nIts a weird space where box office numbers are still the focus, but they make it more convenient to wait until home release.",
        "I imagine it'll do really well on streaming, especially since it's a front runner for Best Picture.",
        "[deleted]",
        "I’d be very surprised if they didn’t do a theatrical rerelease around award season",
        "&gt; Those vista vision shots\n\nI was *transfixed*, could have watched that for hours.\n\nI‘d also like to point out how funny this film is. Leo does a bonafide cholo whistle at one point, but the highlight has to be the revolutionary call center experience.",
        "Benicio's little dance when he gets pulled over. So many outstanding comedic moments...",
        "I thought I couldn't laugh any harder when the shadowy racial purity group called themselves the Knights of Christmas and greeted each other with \"hail Santa\" and then one of them said \"so she's a semen demon\".",
        "8:15",
        "Ahhhi’ve had a few",
        "Warner Brothers has had an extremely profitable year so far, I doubt they’ll mind taking a monetary loss on this one since it’ll build prestige when it’s nominated for everything at the Oscars",
        "If it wins a bunch of Oscars whoever spent that money will still see it as a win. It'll make a bunch of the difference back over the next decade since its a true classic that will continue to sell.",
        "Yeah, all but two of PTA's movies have been box office failures, I doubt there was an expectation for this to be a box office success. ",
        "PTA has an angel investor. As long as that person is alive his movies will get made. \n\nPatronage lifecycle never ended. ",
        "Honestly if I was rich as fuck I’d totally bankroll crazy shit like this too.",
        "Right? Fuck building space shuttles, I’d be getting PTA and Denis Villneuve to make all my passion projects",
        "[deleted]",
        "PTA movies have always lost money but the studios take the hit because he’s one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. It’s known throughout the industry",
        "Phantom Thread for example",
        "Like Parasite, I expect it'll pick up a bunch of awards and (if they're smart) they'll send it back to theaters. And I expect it to have a very long tail on rental/streaming."

They knew they couldn't just straight up ban Christianity though - and instead aimed to slowly rebrand elements of it into a fascist aesthetic. A big part of this was Nazi-washing Santa Claus as a German folk hero, rather than a Christian holiday figure. They talk about it on the recent episodes of the Behind the Bastards podcast about Heinrich Himmler.\n\nI'm not sure if this was the inspiration behind the Christmas Adventurers, but I thought it was an interesting parallel nonetheless.",

        "The first trailer that was being played in theaters made it seem like a straight up comedy. The second one started playing a few weeks ago and made it seem like a drama. After seeing it, both were right. The daughter is in a drama and Leo is in a comedy.",

        "Only marketing I’ve seen is Letterboxd reviews being posted on Reddit lol. Went to see it in london today and it was actually packed in the theatre to be fair which is nice",
        "The trailers completely changed tone a week ago.  Was showing a bunch of characters but mostly the daughter, with a focus on action.  Now it is all Leo and very silly.",
        "It's actually all of things, basically. Except for the Gran Torino part.",

        "Asking very earnestly as someone who’s been playing trailers for it at my theater for months and beyond thrilled to see it tomorrow: do you think you could’ve cut a trailer that did it justice?\n\nI’m not asking in a “let’s see you do better” smarmy way. I know how to *tell* people what the movie’s about; I’ve sold tickets with “part action thriller, part absurdist satire about our current political moment, part father-daughter drama, and somehow it all works together.” But I have no clue how you would *show* that in a trailer without it being a confusing mess. Their best attempt was throwing out trailers with a variety of tones, hoping people would see enough of them to put the pieces together.\n\nThat approach definitely didn’t work well for preparing people for it. Even audience members that ultimately came out thrilled with the movie were commenting during their bathroom breaks that they thought it was going to be a more pure comedy. I think WB has somewhat resigned themselves to the reality that it’s going to rely on word-of-mouth, a space where you can tell rather than show.",
        "Nope, having seen the movie the trailers are probably as good as you can get without spoiling tons of the movie.\n\nThey give you just enough taste of what you will get and it took me awhile to have it \"click\" like you said.\n\nI still remember seeing the first trailer and wondering what the hell is this? But boy oh boy am I glad I saw it.",
        "Have PTA movies ever made money? \n\nDon't answer that - **There Will Be Blood** and **Boogie Nights** were minor hits and a couple of others barely made their production budget. I read once that indie studios wearily pass around the duty of making his movies, knowing they'll lose money every time, but with a nominal understanding that they'll at least be making something that'll win awards/prestige and be talked about for years. No idea how true that is, but in terms of making money, he's like latter-day John Carpenter - even if I cheer for him, I don't understand how he stays employed.\n\nWild that there's a *nine-figure* budget this time though, that's new. The kind of success this needs to be to even break even is way beyond anything he's put out.",

        "The marketing companies know that political messaging really turns off general audiences. If they marketed this as a political thriller, the reaction would be utter rejection. This just leaves them trying to market it as \"Big Lewboski meets Taken\" which is too vague and not that interesting to general audiences either. They were screwed one way or another with this film.",
        "I’ve avoided trailers but I assume the marketing presents more of the action side, which is probably the right call in terms of putting asses in seats. Combine that with the A Cinemascore, and the fact it’s mindblowingly topical, even if it doesn’t open huge I could see that adding up to good word-of-mouth.\n\nBut I am waiting for the political controversy to start up, no way a movie can be this pointed in this moment and not spark some kind of a wrongheaded backlash.",

        "Ok.. I love PTA, Leo, and Del Toro I was hyped for this after all of the positive reviews. I’m sorry guys, but what am I missing? I loved the scenery and cinematography in the desert at the end. The car chase was good. I just didn’t think this was movie of the year quality like I’d been told.",
        "Right there with ya. Leo was great, and the chase scene looked great, but otherwise I found the film to be a poorly paced cartoonish mess. 🤷",
        "I don’t know about that. It’s a very well made movie. But it’s not like it’s going to be this generation’s Network. I don’t even know if film can have that kind of effect anymore. ",
        "To say its some specific political message or contribution to old ideas of culture wars is missing the point. It is it is intentionally absurdist/vague to focus more on how the older spectrum of politics make things a mess for the younger generations just trying to live a normal life. Their bullshit is over staying its reality. Which is why some of the 70s style stuff in contrast to the contemporary setting fit so well. I think its supposed to feel out of place.\n\nSean Penn and Leo/Taylor represent kind of cartoons of the political spectrum/stereotypes that dominated US for so long. Burnt out lefties, that blur the line of righteousness and self indulgence. Good intentions but kind of all over the place. Sean Penn being a cartoon of hyper nationalist, patriotism to the point of racism. Destructive for what is ultimately petty ego/insecurity and meaningless corporate gain. At the same time, they are both inexplicably drawn to each other in a tornado of sex and violence.\n\nIt has all led to a chaotic, absurdist landscape where they both continue to play out their messy entanglements. Which is where the daughter and other younger characters come in. They are just trying to live normal lives but have to deal with all the shit they had no part in creating. Similar to the immigrants in the film, they're caught up in political tug of war being used as pawns for various interests with very few people actually looking out for them.",
        "Unfortunately I think most audiences are going to see it as “revolutionaries good, government bad” and not read any deeper than that",
        "Conversation? Everything is fueled by tribalism and aromization. It's \"everythuone who desagrees on me on anything, is a monster to be destroyed\". And it's from all sides. And most people think it doesn't apply to them so it only fuel blinds spots and biases.\n\n\nSecond point vast majority of movie goers just want to be sedated from real life it seems. I'm not advocating for movie elitism but most people use it as a means of escapism and not a trigger for social movements, much less nuanced ones. \n\n\nIt seems like we'll intentioned yet wishful thinking on the part of the author. ",

I actually think that movie is about the best movie you could get considering the circumstances, working on a sequel to a beloved film hated by the original author and simultaneously trying to honor both the first film and the author and his book at the same time.

It felt like a weird choice to revisit such a classic (both the book and the movie), but Mike Flanagan pulled it off.

This is a father-daughter story, one that likely reminisces on PTA’s own anxieties about raising biracial children in the current political climate, of which it satirizes but never makes a distinctive statement nor digs too deep below the surface. \n\nAnd despite its satirical tone, there are aspects of this film that can be deeply uncomfortable for various groups on the left.",

It is fine that the politics weren't the focus but the movie was nearly 3 hours, could have done more. \n\n\nNothing wrong with the film on any significant level, but far from a masterpiece. Some films i could easily articulate why the are more than very good or even great. But many masterpieces of art highly resemble good works of art, the former just has that je ne sai quoi. Art is extremely subjective though.\n\n\nWhite supremacists in positions of power, ice type raids, very relevant, could have done more. Del toro was throughly underused, peopĺe talk about penn so much, but I was far more impressed with del toro.\n\n\nI saw a review for TWBB that claims PTA was trying too hard to make a masterpiece, to me it applies to One battle far more. ",

        "The politics is toned down because the novel it's based on is really really specific to a political moment that would be impossible to put to film properly. It's based on Vineland, which is a novel about what happened to violent leftists like the surviving members of the weather underground decades after their heyday. For that to work, the audiences would have to understand the politics and legacy of those groups, as well as what being a leftist was like in the nixon and reagan era. PTA loves vineland but didn't want to adapt it and fail, so he wrote a screenplay inspired by it.",
        "I saw the trailer and despite loving every other PTA movie, I thought this one might be the exception. Then I saw some negative reviews and decided to just skip it. But it kept nagging at me that I should give it a go because it’s a PTA movie, so I did. I ended up loving it! I’ve watched it 3 times now and enjoy it more each time.",
        "I finished it feeling so... Drained.\n\nIt has been a while since a movie took that much out of me. I couldn't tell if I liked it because I appreciated the skill, or hated it because it took so much out of me. \n\nI need a second watch.",

        "Because there's a pretty powerful and openly political message regarding those in power that reflects on what is currently going on with fascist xenophobia and gov't entities like ICE. Right-wingers who hate immigrants are not going to like this movie, plus it stars Leo and Sean Penn who are what all right-wingers think of as \"Hollywood liberals\".\n\nEdit: okay people I get it, you're \"left\" and thought it sucked.

        "In a bit of subtle social commentary, those guys were all police. Not ICE or military judging by the \"police\" writing on their uniforms.",
        "They were \"MKU\" working with local law enforcement. The film doesn't define that acronym, as far as I know.",

        "I enjoyed the movie, but I personally felt like the first ~40 minutes were too overtly.. aggressive? Edgy? I don't know what the word is, but I felt like they were trying too hard to lean into stereotypes and went overboard on the whole sex addict/power trip thing.\n  \nI get how it contributes to the personality of the characters and makes you take a broader look at flawed people and their mindset, but I felt like they were leaning *way* too heavily into it. I really liked the rest of the movie, but the beginning was a tough watch for me.",
        "Movie definitely sets the tone early that it's messaging is going to be very ham-fisted.",
        "Yeah the beginning wasn’t for me. I thought to myself “oh this is not what I was expecting” but then the second and third act were amazing and I loved it. \n\nI think it has a lot to do with the mom/girlfriend character being pretty unlikable. Shit mom, shit partner, and shit comrad.",
        "The car chase at the end was absolutely spectacular. You felt like you got to watch it as the culmination of everything in her life up to that point.",

        "I also wasn't into the first 40 minutes but the rest of the movie pulled me in as soon as they moved on to Willa. the beginning was just weird.",
        "Frenetic is how I'd describe it. It's my favorite movie of the year as is but I feel like they could have cleaned up the first act quite a bit.",
        "It satirises both extremes of the political spectrum brilliantly which inevitably leads to most people finding a reason to dislike it in this polarised age. I think in the future it’ll be seen as a classic.",
        "[deleted]",
        "The chase scene had the best and most interesting camera work of anything this year. The daughter realizing the rolling hills broke sight lines and using that to spring her trap was so good AND it tied into the incredible cinematography of that scene which is top tier film making.\n\nBenicio stole every scene he was in. His casual competence and unbothered attitude was great every second he was on screen.\n\nThe comedy I think worked incredibly well, Leo falling from the roof then getting tased couldn't have been better. The running gag of him being late to pretty much every major moment was good. And his constant fighting with the hotline guy was hilarious imo. Especially when his buddy from the old days gave him the quiz and was like \"trust me, you'll know the answer.\"\n\nThe satirized villains were fun. How can you not think the guy bringing up semen demons was top tier?\n\nThe first act until it fast forwards was definitely jumbled and rough, but once that's all established and we get to modern Leo the movie was as good as any I've seen in ten years. Of the 50+ movies from 2025 I watched it's firmly in first place for me. I just don't think any others had the performances this one did outside of begonia.",
        "That’s kind of the criticism though. A movie that looked great but had messy story elements and poor characterisation of several of it’s main characters. Including the daughter which was essentially just a plot device.",
        "Same here. It's in my 2025 top 10 but it's not first.",
        "You’re right but also this film very very clearly comes down in favor of the left wing and despises the fascistic turn the right has made in this country. ",
        "I kind of just thought the movie was ok. The acting was good but I just wasn’t blown away by it or anything.",
        "Personally I felt that the acting and cinematography made me think that the story would be something else than how one dimensional and flat it was. It was okay as you put it.",
        "Sean Penn’s character was such a laughable caricature but maybe that was the point.",
        "I literally just got done watching it and this is how I felt too and reading some of these comments saying it’s a masterpiece make me feel like I missed something :(",
        "I believe \"meh\" is the word you're searching for.",
        "same, and that goes for every PTA film I watched other than There will be blood.\n\nthe politics isn't the problem in this movie for me, it's that outside of being mildly funny there are no interesting characters and the story is bare bones.",
        "Yeah. It was fine. The music is awful imo, but I know some folks really liked the plink-plonk piano laid over the whole thing.",
        "I didnt enjoy this one.",
        "Love me some Benicio, but wasn’t he just playing himself? Penn had to dig much, much deeper imo",
        "I enjoyed the fact that Leo's character was seemingly unaware of the whole underground railroad that Benicio was running.",
        "Too focused on figuring out what time is it.",
        "Trying to charge his phone.",
        "I could not tell it was Sean Penn for half the movie, I hadnt paid attention to the cast beyond Leo. What a bizarre character lol. Benedecio Del Toro was absolutely hilarious in it though. He was perfectly zen contrasted with Leo's insanity."

I don’t like DiCaprio usually, and PTA movies have always seemed self indulgent.  But ma, they nailed it.  The script was so propulsive and I never seemed to know where it was going next.  Sean Penn always overacts, but he overacted in such a cartoon remarkable way that the character was kinda terrifying in how stupid and needy he was.  (Why is your shirt so tight…I can see the lifts in your shoes).  Del toro was as great as ever.  The cinematography was interesting, especially the chase scenes..  The topic was timely without being preachy.  And we don’t seem to get great epic movies for grownups that are still interesting and fun.  Really really impressed.",

        "When something like Don’t Look Up releases reviewers are mad it’s too on the nose. When a movie like this releases people are somehow still mad because it either says too much or too little. I agree with your take mostly though, it’s a topical dramedy making fun of white suprematists and the ridiculousness of the situation we have going on with handling immigration. Not much more than that.",
        "I thought it was well done except &gt;!the daughter and her phone. Like, everyone and their fucking dog has known for decades now that law enforcement traces your fucking phone as step one. This was a major plot point in Enemy of the State, and that movie was **27** years ago, longer than Willa would have been alive (heck, longer than the actress playing her has been alive). Since she seems way more accepting of their lives as ex revolutionaries than burn-out Bob is, and is able to handle protocol better, to have her refuse to give up her phone, especially as she sees the law enforcement convoy on the way to the school dance she just left, it just seems like an instance of a character being stupid to drive the plot, which I hated as soon as it happened because so much after became painfully predictable.!&lt;",

For one, she’s never seen this violence or family history she learned about, for all she knows it’s just a thing of the past.\n\nIn our family she’d sneak out of her bedroom window AND not connect the dots that the camera outside their house would see her. Her brain literally isn’t fully developed, hence why I believe this plot point to be a possibility.",
        "To be fair to the plot, it was a \"hidden\" cell phone that her father didn't even know she had.  Maybe her thinking her friends were the only ones knowing of its existence was the saving grace to keep it.  Also, she's a teenage girl.  They don't want to part from their phones and don't think rationally when being phoneless is the outcome.",
        "I thought it made total sense.  She had no experience of the revolutionary stuff from 16 years ago.  To her, I’m sure it was her burnout paranoid dad and she was all “yeah yeah whatever.  Fine, I’ll take the little transponder thing &lt;rolls eyes&gt;.”   Definite 16 year old behavior.",

        "Watched this weekend.  Why do I feel like I'm the only one who did not get this movie?  Was it a commentary on political extremism?  Was it a father willing to risk it all for the love of his daughter?  Was it taking Brad Pitt's \"Floyd\" from True Romance and making him the main character?  Was it an experiment to see if the audience could feel tension for 150+ minutes?\n\nIt was a little bit of a lot of things, but I don't know if any of those things made the movie enjoyable for me.",
        "It's an alternate history novel where the US is a lot more overt with racism. It's a totalitarian state, and we see the efforts of both side of the conflict attempt to get some meaning out of it.\n\nI think it's pretty rad.",
        "I knew it was adapted (I've read the adaptation is \"loose\"), but wasn't familiar with the source novel.  I know Pynchon is an intense author though.\n\nI also didn't realize it was supposed to take place in an alternate history.  That actually explains a bit.",
        "It was about legacy, generational change, and the evolution of the revolutionary ideals in modern America.\n\nI heard about an interview with PTA and he explained that One Battle After Another is set in present day because there was no need to place it in a certain time as this struggle has been going on for long and certainly ongoing, even more heightened now perhaps than ever since he wrote the thing, even from when it was being shot.",
        "It was so easy to tell this movie was made by a white well-off liberal person. What \"struggle\" is he alluding to? Immigration? Which Bernie Sanders just a decade ago called a ploy by the Koch brothers to undermine the working class? The only \"social\" issue the film speaks to is the \"plight\" of immigrants. Poverty, environmental issues,  healthcare, education etc. are nowhere to be found. ",
        "It may have been a little ambitious (impossible?) to try to also fit in poverty, healthcare, education issues in a 2 hour film with the Willa/Bob/Sensei story.. \n\nIt's not that those things don't exist. There were large scale protests in the film and it didn't seem to be an odd thing.",
        "Oh poop, I could've saved $10 on Saturday night if I knew this.",
        "It’s good to support theaters and this movie is better on the big screen , especially that car chase at the end. Money well spent",

        "I really, really hoped it could sneak a BP nom but I don’t think it will happen. Plus we will already have 2, maybe 3 foreign language films as BP noms.",
        "And neon is already campaigning those 2 with noc in third. Maybe 4th after how well sirat did",
        "Doubt it will win, but that Nick Cave song at the end of Train Dreams was sublime",
        "The entirety of Train Dreams was sublime. That movie will stick with me for a very long time.",
        "People either love it, or find it boring. It's more apathy working against it than anything. It's not too common that a movie as beloved as Train Dreams is met with just \"too boring\" and \"too slow\" rather than just outright hate. I think that bodes very well for it when it comes to nominations. In other years, I think there would at least be a conversation of a dark horse best picture run for it. Though very different films, it reminds me a bit of Killers of the Flower Moon in that regard.",
        "I don't get how Warfare isn't there for sound. The Civil War snub was terrible last year and now they're repeating it.",
        "The show of force fly overs were insane even in a regular theater.",
        "The show of force fly overs I could feel in my bones.",
        "This one is insane. Absolutely should be.",
        "Warfare by FAR had the best sound design of any movies I saw this year.",
        "I really thought they should be included solely off the strength of &gt;!the IED scene!&lt;",
        "I saw Warfare in theatres half because the sound  in CIVIL WAR was just on another level",
        "I only kind of liked the movie.\n\nBut the sound was phenomenal and innovative.  Shameful snub.",
        "The scene immediately following some ordnance going off absolutely FLOORED me in theaters. I've never heard gunshots sound like that before, and I don't think I'll ever forget it.",
        "Sound and casting honestly. It's just an insane cast and most of them will be stars in the future.",
        "Odd too, given that the tech awards are all nominated by experts in their field.\n\nSound has been weird for a couple years now.",
        "Here's the films with the most mentions, ranked:\n\n**#1 (tied):**\n\nSinners - 8\n\nWicked For Good - 8\n\n**#2:**\n\nFrankenstein - 6\n\n**#3 (tied):**\n\nOne Battle After Another - 5\n\nSirat - 5\n\nF1 - 5\n\n**#4:**\n\nAvatar: Fire and Ash - 4\n\n**#5 (tied):**\n\nTron Ares - 3\n\nTrain Dreams - 3",
        "Tron - Ares on a top 10 list for the year. What a time for cinema",
        "At least the categories it got short-listed for make some semblance of sense over stuff like Screenplay or Performance, though the soundtrack doesn't reach the heights of Legacy's for me.\n\nHopefully more deserving films get nominated over it.",
        "Hamnet also got 3 mentions (Casting, Cinematography, Score)",
        "Wicked For Good???",
        "I feel like the Academy generally picks a pop art film to be the one that gets the technical awards and maybe a best picture nomination. I imagine that’ll be Wicked For Good with possibly some acting nominations, but I don’t imagine it’ll actually win many awards.",
        "Wicked is a commercially successful, well reviewed juggernaut, it’ll definitely get a ton of nominations but since the second movie is weaker I think the only way it’s squeaking in with wins is if the other nominees aren’t strong this year.",
        "Well reviewed by who? It’s got 68% on RT and 58% on Metacritic",
        "I mean, remember Wicked last year? It got 10 nominations",
        "I'm a bit disappointed that Son Lux's score for *Thunderbolts** and Young Fathers' score for *28 Years Later* were not shortlisted, since those were the scores I listened to the most this year.",
        "Captain America: Brave New World getting in over Thunderbolts and Fantastic 4 is certainly a choice",
        "What the heck? The other two MCU scores this year were either great (T-Bolts) or otherwise memorable and fitting (F4).\n\nBNW did not stand out to me at all.",
        "If the BNW had reused Falcons theme from the F&amp;WS show then it wouldve made it far more memorable.\n\nNot sure why Henry Jackman wasnt asked to do it in the first place and Im not sure why they didnt get Laura Karpman to include that theme either way.\n\nIt was similar with the Marvels film not reusing the Captain Marvel or Ms Marvel theme at all. Which is made all the weirder considering Karpman scored the Ms Marvel show as well",
        "I absolutely love Young Fathers and I don't usually listen to OSTs but the 28 Years Later soundtrack was one of my favourite albums of this year, especially the song Promised Land\n\n^(Their best Danny Boyle collab is still Only God Knows from the Trainspotting 2 soundtrack)\n\n^(my introduction to them was their song GET UP after they won the Mercury Prize and that is either the best introduction to them or the worst cos it goes straight to 11 immediately)",
        "That song absolutely slaps. The entire opening still gives me chills. Then we head right into Spike’s introduction with that very 90s/early 00s sounding pop punk song. Perfection",
        "I’m with you on the Thunderbolts score, one of my favourites of the year, it’s such a unique non “traditional” superhero movie score. I know they got nominated for EEAAO, but I vastly prefer this one, so emotionally loaded and thoughtful to each character",
        "Underrated scores. The issue is that they come from big genre films and the Academy rarely recognizes these films to begin with.\n\n\"It's Bucky!\" By Son Lux and \"Pals\" by Young Fathers go so hard.",
        "Yet despite this Captain America: Brave New World somehow got onto the Best Score shortlist.",
        "I don't remember a single musical note from Captain America: Brave New World but Bucky's theme from Thunderbolts still makes my hairs stand on end every time I hear it.",
        "That's just insane to me. How did that get in there?",
        "Fantastic 4 is better than both IMO. Some of Giacchino's best work",
        "The main Thunderbolts theme with hints of the Avengers theme in it is just perfect for what they become.",
        "I can’t believe 28 Years Later hasn’t been nominated for anything tbh. Danny Boyle is the goat",
        "Some of those choices for score....mmm 😐",
        "Only about half of them will actually be nominated.",
        "I hope I Lied to You wins best song. \n\nThe website doesn’t behave super great on mobile so I’m not sure if it just cut off for me, but is there no Best Picture shortlist yet? \n\nIt’d be really shit if No Other Choice didn’t get nominated. It’s between that and Sinner for me when it comes to best picture.",
        "There is never a shortlist published for the above-the-line categories (picture, director, actor/actress)",
        "&gt;I hope I Lied to You wins best song.\n\nWas an unreal experience in theatre. Probably my favorite sequence in a film this year.",
        "Feel like its absolutely a two horse race between that and Golden. If you incorporate the experience from the film, I Lied to You would be the winner by far. But it also might be difficult to overcome the absolute cultural phenomenon Golden and KPDH became as a whole.",
        "Even if I think I lied To You is a better song, I kinda want Golden to win just because the popular song that captured the general audiences attention hasn't won in a while. \n\nNot saying it is the Academy's fault, but The People™ clearly wanted \"We don't talk about Bruno\" (not submitted to favor Dos Orugitas), \"I'm Just Ken\" (lost to the more traditional Oscar song from the same movie), and \"Defying Gravity\" (didn't meet eligibility criteria) over the winners. I don't think the Academy can do it for the 4th time in the same decade.",
        "I totally forgot that \"I'm Just Ken\" *didn't* win that year, because that was the best moment in the ceremony.\n\nThat and Naatu Naatu are what I point to when I say I want the performances back this year.",
        "I wouldn’t be upset if Golden won but that’s purely on a (for lack of a better word) political reason. \nSo many things that are loved by women and girls is see as silly and vapid just for being loved by women and girls. \n\nIt’s nice to see something popular with that demographic getting praise. \n\nSeeing a bunch of 20-50 year old men making videos of them rocking out to KPDH was one of the highlights of my year",
        "The shots of the spirits from various periods of time dancing, especially the gangstas from LA with the G-Funk synths coming in, was insane",
        "Absolutely INSANE in theaters. Took my breath away, truly. when we left I said “can specific scenes win Oscar’s? Because that needs to”",
        "It blows the other songs out of the water",
        "Damn, No “The Long Walk” for Casting. That would be personal choice to win it.",
        "On the other hand, weapons in best casting is pretty cool &amp; inspired. The crazier part was its snub in makeup, but here’s hoping my girl Gladys makes it in",
        "I know it shouldn't be the factor that wins best casting, but the fact that nearly the entire cast was replaced months before shooting and it feels pretty much perfectly cast is a feat. The original cast was already great and yet the actors we got might be even better choices.",
        "I agree! That's the logic for me and why I'd probably vote for it.",
        "I wonder how many mega projects are being deliberately delayed for another couple of years, in order to be featured in the \"100th\" anniversary Oscar event?",
        "Literally zero. Why would you risk a project (a mega one at that) costing more, losing attached talent or completely falling apart on the off chance it gets a nomination at the one Oscar ceremony that will be LEAST focused on celebrating the current nominees, and overstuffed with celebrations of the history of the ceremony itself?",
        "Wrong F1 song, should have been Lose My Mind",
        "Was thinking the same! Loved that song and the montage that went with it",
        "Ridiculous Warfare wasn’t even shortlisted for Sound",
        "Best International Feature will be the most competitive one as they are a lot of good movies in the short list.",
        "I hope Ugly Stepsister wins makeup. It was such a weird and interesting movie.  One of my favorites of the year!",
        "Surprised Hamnet is on the best score shortlist, considering they used the piece that disqualified Arrival. \n\nAlso surprised Sirat has this much momentum. Idk how it's doing internationally, but nobody in the states is talking about it. \n\nDisappointed FF didn't get a vfx slot, but I guess that Twilight baby dragged the whole thing down",
        "If people haven't seen Sound of Falling, and you enjoy a good long foreign film, watch it. It's damn good. ",
        "I know it was a very long shot but damn I wish The Long Walk had been shortlisted for best score or casting.",
        "Jeremiah Fraites was campaigning more for Springsteen than Long Walk which is a huge missed opportunity",
        "It's not listed on that site outside of song, but Kpop Demon Hunters will do very well. I'm not even sure what competition it will have in the animated category besides Zootopia 2, and I'm pretty certain Golden will win best song. That track dominated multiple top 40s around the world.",
        "I'll be really curious to see how Casting goes in its introductory year. My gut says that OBAO is the frontrunner here (probably deservedly) and if it's on its way to winning Best Picture along with one or two acting wins, it's hard to see it not being the winner there as well. \n\nHonestly, I could see this category being the major indicator on awards night for what film will win as it seems very possible that voters will put their best picture and Casting selections together on their ballots. That may evolve after a few years when the category has found its legs and people are more nuanced with their voting but I wont be shocked to see those two categories match up this year.",
        "Predator Badlands should have a nod for the score",
        "This, plus VFX and sound. All 3 things were fantastic. ",
        "Was kind of hoping Weapons would get one for hairstyling and makeup"

        "Saw it last night at a press screening. It was awesome. One of PTA’s best.",
        "Well he has made 9 movies with 4 (boogie nights, there will be blood, the master, and phantom thread) being objective masterpieces….so top 5?",
        "The fact that you don't include magnolia in his list of masterpieces is concerning to me haha\n\nTbh I even personally put punch drunk love &gt; phantom thread or master",
        "I’d put it among those films yeah.",
        "I'd include Punch Drunk Love in my top 5. One of my favorite Adam Sandler performance.",
        "I never doubted PTA, but seeing so many perfect scores is still insane. 5/5, 10/10\n\nEdit: ALL the big publications have it at 100/100 on Metacritic",
        "Even for PTA, this is unfathomable praise for him. This is a true “universal” film that’s just getting heaps of praise ",
        "PTA films always get positive reviews but they’re usually a bit tempered in their enthusiasm since they’re often very highbrow and difficult to grasp the meaning of. (I’m thinking of The Master, which I felt was a great movie even though I don’t think I got the point). Seeing all these 5-star reviews has me pumped up.",
        "It’s basically the first action movie he’s ever made, to use the term broadly. Hard Eight doesn’t really fit imo. \n\nImagine a director like PTA harnessing his powers to deliver those types of thrills. I can easily believe it’s not only amazing but a lot more approachable than his other work. It should certainly be his biggest box office hit by far, and not just cause of Leo, though that doesn’t hurt. ",
        "I know he’s pretty new as a director, but what you’re describing is kind of how I felt about Zach Kregger’s Weapons.  \nIt has all sorts of great craftsmanship that is deservedly earning him critical praise, but he also made a distinct effort to make it fucking *fun*.",
        "something I appreciate about PTAs work, in general, is that it appears he's not terribly concerned with \"making a point\". He has said in interviews that he really just focuses on what he believes are \"the facts\" of the story. He doesnt steer the story in the direction of the conclusion; he creates the setting, and the characters, and then just follows the story as he believes it would unfold. The result is a movie that is very observational and lived-in, and just like real life doesnt have simple, obvious lessons at the end.",
        "“I know writers who use subtext, and they’re all cowards.” \n\n- PTA",
        "[removed]",
        "That’s why he one of the goat directors ever",
        "Went to a screening last night. It's CRAZY GOOD. I can't stop thinking about it. I really suggest to stop reading anything about it and watch it fresh. I want to see it now on the various formats as well.",
        "I was iffy on the film because the trailer tones are all over the place and I wasn't sure if this was a goofy comedy or a serious drama.\n\nNow i'm 100% in and looking forward to it.",
        "What’d you expect? DiCaprio, Penn, Del Toro, and an excellent director?",
        "Buster Keaton mixed with the action of Fury Road is one hell of a pitch.",

        "I like the way you think",
        "The trailers don't give that impression at all.",
        "If there’s anything that could be an Achilles heel for it in terms of box office performance, it’s that the hooks and vibes are easy to tell but very hard to show.\n\nI’ve been running trailers for this thing for six months now. The [first one](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=feOQFKv2Lw4) was the best, IMO, for how it tried to strike a balance of all the elements of what’s going on - the comedy, the action, the politics, the family story. Everything else afterwards focused in on one or two of them - and unless you’re programming trailers or going to the movies a ton, you’re probably only seeing one or two of them and only getting a sliver of what’s going on.\n\nHopefully, it pulls a Sinners and generates insane word-of-mouth; once people can tell their friends what they saw, they’ll come see it.",
        "I've been interested in this movie just to see what PTA does with a big budget plus Leo usually chooses good roles, but the trailers really have done very little for me and I wasn't originally going to rush out for this one. These reviews have changed my mind, I'm there opening night",
        "As someone who goes to the movies a lot, I'd wondered why there were so many different trailers for this movie, and why each one seems to be trying to sell it entirely differently. There's a huge gulf between the one that seemed to be pushing it as a serious examination of Sovereign Citizen types, and others where it felt like a whacky Wes Anderson-lite.",
        "Honestly, that makes sense. Every trailer the tone has felt completely different and it's been hard to read what this film is.",
        "Fury Road just is The General though lol",
        "Two legitimate masterpieces though, I'll allow it.",
        "Over 4 hour erection 911 call incoming\n\nEDIT / after seeing this… this was kinda prophetic",

        "&gt; The trailers didn’t blow me away but quickly jumping up my anticipation list \n\nHonestly, the trailers put me off of the movie. The first one I kept seeing made it seem like a quirkier Wes Anderson type movie, and the last few that've been in theaters seem a lot darker and serious in tone.\n\nIf the reviews are this strong though, I'll have to check it out.",
        "Same. Nothing in the trailers stood out except two kinda cringe-inducing jokes. I have my hopes up again",
        "Saw it last night. Weird to say about a PTA film, but it may be the best action film of the year. Like a funny Mad Max Fury Road with a bit of social commentary added in.",
        "Is that implying that Fury Road doesn’t have social commentary?",
        "This marks the first film to achieve such a high Metascore with a substantial number of reviews since *~~Moonlight~~* ~~(2016)~~  Parasite in 2019",
        "Parasite 2019",
        "While it has the same score as Parasite (97), if you sort by all time it'll show that OBAA is technically a higher 97 (for now). It's the 4th highest reviewed movie this century on Metacritic, behind only Boyhood, Moonlight, and Pan's Labyrinth.",
        "Wow, one five-star review after another.",
        "The metacritic rating is incredible. 23 reviews is a lot for that metric, and 98 is just insane. This may go down as one of the most well-reviewed movies ever. \n\nToo bad RT removed the average critic rating (why again?) because that fucker is probably sky high too.  \n\nLet’s wait and see if Armond White brings RT down to 99% heh.\n\nOh it’s already down to 97%. Movie’s a flop. ",
        "If there's one thing I've learned it's that Armond White will do anything for attention",

        "Which is also extremely high for Metacritic. \n\n90 is rarified air for movies, truly (it’s a bit different for TV). Like 90 itself for a movie is insane.\n\n97+ or so, if this movie lands there, is something else. ",

        "This is literally something out of The Studio s1",

        "He is my favorite filmmaker. There are a few films of his I really didn’t care for, mainly Licorice Pizza and Inherit Vice, but even then, his mastery is always on display. I have never been more excited for a film. I pre-ordered 70mm tickets the day I could.",
        "Greyest living director IMO. Second of all time only to Kubrick",

        "Seamen demon lmao",
        "Is it just me, or does the newer trailer(s) running currently look like a totally different movie from the ones playing earlier this year?",
        "Agreed, it presents a wildly different tone. The first and second trailers also felt different, although not as much as the more recent one.\n\n\nIt makes it very hard to tell what type of movie this is.",
        "Glad I’m not the only one. The first trailers made it seem more comedic, while the new one has a darker tone.",
        "interestingly enough, having seen it, I can tell you both tones exist within the movie. its hilarious but also very dark at the same time",
        "I already feel sick from excitement, this isn’t helping!",
        "Just got to see an advanced screening tonight. Full disclosure, I’m a huge PTA fan, so I might be biased, but I loved it. One of my favorite movies this year, possibly in the top spot. Greenwood’s score is like a tense machine rolling over you. Sean Penn really surprised me with his maniacal performance. Leo is like an angry, divorced Jeff Lebowski. The movie seemed like it took place in the same world as Eddington. So much dumbassery to hilarious effect, peppered with tense action and shocking violence. \n\nI don’t want to hype it more than it already is but I really loved it and I think a lot of people will too.",
        "Stoked to watch it on the 25th!!",
        "Calling it now, this is winning best picture and Anderson is finally getting his first Oscar",
        "&gt;One Battle After Another’—Starring DiCaprio—Becomes Best-Reviewed Movie This Decade On Metacritic.\n\nWow.",
        "This will probs get downvoted to oblivion, but Honestly I was really excited for it and it was SUPER underwhelming. So underwhelming that I would guess while perhaps 40% of the folks genuinely like it, the rest are literally just pretending because a few critics set the ball rolling in that direction and now people are gas lighting themselves into thinking this is some genius movie. \n\nIt’s a cute attempt at a parody of both the ultra left as well as the ultra right. Anyone who did not see that the film parodies both sides is just too deep in their own politics (seems many ppl on the internet) \n\nThe parodies themselves were really on the nose and not the least bit clever. The mediocre nature of the parodies would have been fine if there was absolutely anything else to the movie, but there really wasn’t. The story and characters themselves were not compelling (except maybe pref— her character def inspired real anger and disgust) \n\nI will also mark that I have a strong bias against gratuitous use of sexual themes to get viewers. I’m okay with necessary inclusion of sex or sexual Themes, but to make multiple characters out to be nympho fucking maniacs is a bit much. Not just distasteful but seriously dangerous messaging (and yes ppl watch movies and think that’s what real life is)",
        "Currently sitting at 98 on metacritic.",
        "This movies doing 2016 LeBron number. Holy crap",
        "This is the \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" of movies",
        "Reminding me personally of LA Confidental. Trailer was playing before everything in 97 and looked meh. I would consider it a 10/10 movie.\n\nTrailer for this looked meh. ",
        "Goddam, it looks like we got ourselves a masterpiece.",
        "I'd like to take this opportunity to ask that everyone that's excited to see One Battle After Another takes a detour over the next two weeks to see Inherent Vice, which feels almost like a sister film to One Battle and is my personal favorite PTA movie.",
        "I saw Inherent Vice when it came out and didn’t gel with it. Watched it again last year…holy shit, what a fantastic and hilarious film. I realized I had to stop trying to follow the plot and just let the vibes take over.",
        "Maybe you can help me with this. PTA is one of my favorite filmmakers but something about Inherent Vice really didn’t click with me the first time I watched it. I definitely want to give it a second chance before OBAA comes out, but is there anything I’m missing about Inherent Vice or things I should keep in mind that would help me for a second viewing?",
        "So, to me, you need to view Inherent Vice like it's the story told entirely from Doc Sportello's perspective, not what actually happened. You'll notice that this is a classic Hollywood style narrative and literally follows him in every single scene, never shifting perspective. Once you realize you're viewing the mystery and conspiracy from his perspective and not 100% what happened, you'll probably enjoy it more.\n\nNext is to note the details of every conversation he has throughout the film as it tends to take throwaway lines and turn them into big plot points later on in the narrative. It's a very dialogue heavy film and it's one that you can't really take a scene off for because you'll probably miss something that'll come up in the solution. \n\nLastly, I'd recommend just enjoying the ride. At its core, it is a fun drug and sun soaked detective noir all about something that feels small and turns into something much much bigger and the main character is wholly unprepared or even not even that interested in the actual big deal as opposed to the small personal issues he has to deal with. He's like us in that regard because we sat down to watch a movie that is theoretically about a hippie private detective trying to find his missing ex-girlfriend and by the end he's learned way more about this version of Los Angeles than we ever thought he would.\n\nIf you can't tell, it's one of my favorite movies.",

        "Thank you that somebody else said this! I found the first 30 min of the movie kind of mediocre with people I didn’t really like or care about.\n\nWhen we meet Chase Infiniti and return to a now stoned out DiCaprio, the movie improves dramatically. The movies works far more as a ridiculous action comedy than the knockoff version of “Judas and the Black Messiah” movie they intro was.\n\nThere’s no doubt in my mind that Infiniti, DiCaprio, Del Toro, and Penn are the things that make that movie fun. As somebody else said Amy Madigan or Sally Hawkins should’ve been the obvious winners this year but there’s some odd stigma against horror movies.",

        "Regina Hall did more with less.",
        "I love Teyana’s personality and she did great in the film, but I agree I don’t see it as Oscar winning. Inga’s performance hit me like a truck. I want her to win.",
        "I’m genuinely shocked because I actually found her acting distractingly *bad* in OBAA.  At the very least, it was not a tough role to play.  But I found her performance to be super unconvincing- like I was watching someone act. She was by far the weakest link in the movie, I’d give the daughter an award long before Taylor.",

This year's Cord Jefferson speech.\n* Getting to see Chase Infiniti on my TV 5-6 times.\n* The presenter bits were better and less cringy than last year.\n* Jessie Buckley.\n* Julia Robert's standing ovation. That rocked lol.\n* Hamnet over Sinners is such a cool upset. Both are amazing but I was kinda hoping this one would happen. Really didn't want Hamnet to leave empty-handed.\n* Loved the Rob Reiner shout out at the end with the Spinal Tap hat and \"this one went to 11\" from Nikki.\n* Our boy /u/sevohanian getting to go on stage in that sick white tux and making a speech. First-ever redditor Golden Globes speech perhaps lol?\n\n**The bad:**\n\n* The batshit insane and terrible UFC bit. Yes Paramount/CBS bought the UFC rights and they want to promote it but *surely* they could've come up with something better.\n* The Polymarkets ads with odds of winning so you can live-bet the awards. Are you fucking serious?\n* The Podcast category, get it outta here man what are we doing here.\n* Kleber Mendonça Filho's speech being cut out after only like a minute. Lame.\n* Not having Best Original Score on the broadcast while having a bunch of bits/weird shit. Why just exile that one category?\n* The commenters. No way they're bringing that back next year.\n* The amount (and length) of commercials breaks was truly unbearable.\n* Too much TV stuff, I simply don't care. I wish they did 2 shows, 1 for movies and 1 for TV so I can just not watch the TV one.\n* The music choices for the walkups/walkoff songs were so bad lmao. Like, laughably bad. They've got to work on that. Hey Golden Globes, I have a bright idea, how about playing a song from their respective movie as they're walking up?\n* Bummed about Michael B. Jordan losing.\n* I wish they played clips for all of the acting categories.\n* Really wanted Jonny Greenwood to win for Score over Ludwig.\n\nMore bad than good this year. Typical for the Golden",

        "I wouldn't mind the TV stuff *if* the Globes came before the Emmys. I haven't seen half of the movies yet (RIP international/ non-Western world distribution) but its fun to watch the awards season because you can tell everyone just wants the big shiny Oscar prize and winning the precursor awards matters a huge deal towards influencing the Oscars. With TV, the big shiny prize of the Emmys has already happened. What's the point in seeing Adolescence win for the 10000th time?",

        "Please tell us more!",
        "It was a surreal experience really. I had a cart full of nibbles and small bites that they had requested. I went up to the room they were in and knocked while announcing myself. Leo was gracious enough to hold the door open while Benicio helped me bring the whole thing inside. I did not want to linger as in the past I have had actors rather rudely shoo me away, so I placed the items appropriately and made my way towards the door. Before I could make my exit they had engaged me in conversation. I was melting on the spot. I mean being in and around celebrities is nothing new in my profession but Leo and Benicio both have this aura where you just get captivated. I was almost transfixed and had to snap out of it to be an active participant in the conversation. We talked about my family, the weather, soccer (of all things random). It was a sub-five minute conversation but it felt like a lifetime in the moment. I'm making all this up and not even the OP. They were utterly charming. Fun fact: As I left I could distinctly hear them joke, they were teasing each other about missing out on the next Scorsese script, apparently Marty went younger for the lead.",

It's not as faithful as Inherent Vice as he decided to change the time period for the story.\n\nThe original book was about 1960s hippy radicalism in the face of Reagan's America but PTA has decided to set it in the present which will necessitate many changes. It seems like one of the changes is replacing a focus on the War on Drugs with the resurgence of racism. Apparently Sean Penn's character has been updated from an anti-drug crusader to a white supremacist. DiCaprio's daughter in this movie is played by Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall is the mother.",

I watch movies multiple times but I never watch them so close together but after the first viewing, I literally couldn’t stop thinking about it until I saw it again. I wasn’t familiar with Daniel Day Lewis’s normal speaking voice until after it and knowing he’s a very soft spoken introverted type just adds so much to watching him embody his character so well. I honestly have never seen an actor separate themselves so much. Whether it’s the Bourne movies or The Martian, Matt Damon is Matt Damon. DDL invents a new person all together in TWBB down to the way he holds his face. It’s damn near shapeshifting",
        "Watch DDL in Lincoln. It is so unbelievably well-portrayed. The reedy voice in particular, which Lincoln biographers have noted as being a peculiarity of Lincoln's considering his build (tall and lanky but with near-mythic physical strength) was not really ever replicated in other depictions of Lincoln. DDL nails it.",
        "I actually thought he gave an even better performance in Phantom Thread. It's the polar opposite of TWBB - very understated but you can feel the emotions crackling under the surface.",
        "He really is just plain phenomenal. I'd even argue that he turns in a better performance in My Left Foot. I'd almost put Gangs of New York in that category, but the movie itself isn't nearly as good, even though his performance makes it worth sitting through the whole thing.",

Second, this doesn't look like a PT Anderson movie at all, way out of his wheel house, which again, is awesome.

        "It’s edgy but it’s accessible.\n\nIt has more jokes, it has structure, it has known actors. \n\nLP had mostly unknown actors, it has a very loose structure and plays more as a series of vignettes that eventually concludes. \n\nThis is his most approachable movie, the edginess in politics or having some sexual stuff is nothing.",
        "I’d agree with you except Boogie Nights exists, I’d say that’s expressly his most accessible work so far",
        "Leo losing his shit and Benicio’s quirkiness attracts a lot of people. This film utilized it well.",
        "i mean its an adult comedy/drama",
        "I guess I don’t see it especially more or less challenging compared to his past work.",
        "I laughed quite a bit and the finale sequence was an absolute pleasure.  Probably not the best product placement for IZOD.",
        "Holy shit, IZOD lost the gator in 1993??  Lacoste, then, I guess.  I feel old as shit.",
        "Lacoste must be fuming",
        "Hope the movie , he and Sean Penn get Oscars",
        "Sean Penn gets two Oscars, one for big Penn, one for his “little Penn.”",
        "One for his walk??",
        "Hey, did anyone else get serious *Mad Max* (1979), edge-of-society's-breakdown vibes off of this film? (Not to mention the killer car sequence at the end.)    \n\nI also really like how the film critiques all purity tests (white race, commitment to revolution, DNA, code words, etc.) When facing a unified authoritarianism, the only weapon is a unified anti-authoritarianism.",
        "Yes. Particularly when we got to the more deserty California settings",
        "&gt; Per the latest Gold Derby data, One Battle After Another tops the Best Picture category with a 96.8 percent chance at a nomination, just ahead of the previous leader, Hamnet, at 96.5 percent. Sinners, Sentimental Value, Wicked: For Good, Marty Supreme, Bugonia, It Was Just an Accident, A House of Dynamite, and Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere round out the top 10. \n\nI loved the novel Hamnet, looking forward to the Chloe Zhao film. Would be very interesting if it comes down to Hamnet vs One Battle.\n\nThe opening weekend was good, not great. This is my film of the year so I'm quite happy but everyone is using kids gloves when talking about it's opening. Not too dissimilar from Mickey 17's opening (and similar budget), and that was regarded as a fiasco. \n\nI think anyone at Warner's would be happy with this opening + critical reception + Oscar buzz + all the other successes they had this year like Sinners. BUT I think they'd be a little happier if their marketing for OBAA was a little better, or if they could have trimmed like 20% of the reported budget.",
        "The difference is nobody thought Mickey 17 was the best picture of the year. This is the best picture of the year. It’s going to have a much longer life and make money for Warners. Sure, nobody is getting rich from the opening weekend and I’m sure they’d like to, but these people are already rich. I’m sure Abdey and De Luca are proud to have green lit and made one of the best movies of the last decade.  This is the type of film that will be watched and discussed for years.",
        "Mickey 17 was so bad :-( I really wanted to like it, too, but was extremely disappointed.\n\nI did like the ( quippy letterbox) review of the movie that said something along the lines of “this is a movie that really, really believed Trump was going to lose the election”.",
        "I usually love Mark Ruffalo, but that performance was almost unbearable.",
        "He was so, so, so terrible in it.  He wasn't given much to work with, but it's one of the worst performances I've seen from a seasoned actor.",
        "Lol that's such a great description. This one feels like PTA knew he was going to win.",
        "I just hope Buckley wins best actress. It’s been a long time coming for her, she’s great in everything",
        "It’s a solid opening especially considering how niche PTA is.  This one feels like the narrative is being sold (similar to Sinners, which had such grudging praise from certain corners) vs actually discussing the movie and performance.  The movie has gotten rave reviews and is going to have legs, it’ll be on the full festival circuit, and the opening is very solid.  But it’s being pushed as a flop.",
        "Correct, it should not be called a flop (even though I've seen some outlets say that). PTA is not a draw at all for general audiences, and this was a calculated and acceptable risk.",
        "let's we all agree that we've been blessed this year?  \ngood movies all around",
        "Saw it over the weekend and really liked it. One of four 2025 movies I’ve really enjoyed (Sinners, OBAA, Superman, Weapons).",

        "lol",
        "Barack Orack Orack OBAA",
        "To be fair, I fucking hate how common this is, often with way less context. It's like every name of a film, book, game, even person's name sometimes, is some Herculean task to type out. Why do I have to solve a puzzle just to read a comment?\n\nI'm such a grumpy old man about it, I downvote anyone who does it. That's how I WIN, filthy abbreviated swine.",
        "Exactly. Just type \"One Battle...\" if the full title is too long, goddammit",
        "I use abbreviations, but only after the full name's been used or if I'm replying to someone that's used the full name.",
        "Believe it or not, still jail. Death, then jail, then no dessert",
        "Is it really so hard to spell things out",

        "people really like this PTA fella, huh",
        "i think people are almost sentimental to his films watching them growing up.  and then he made there will be blood which I feel like was a cultural phenomenon",
        "Big Box Office Weekend? The film cost over 130m to make and only made like 20m opening weekend.",
        "60 mil opening, for a non cbm, original movie, from pta - the title is correct",
        "Also it definitely will have long legs ",
        "One leg after another!",

        "I can't stop thinking about it. Going to see it again this weekend.",
        "its a fun movie that some how feels like a hangout movie enveloped in a revolution thriller",
        "The trailers made it look awful. I saw it anyway solely based on PTA’s name and I’m glad I did. But if I wasn’t familiar with his work and just saw a trailer there’s no way I would have paid for two tickets and a sitter.",
        "That’s fair, marketing does matter, but word of mouth and critical acclaim will keep bringing people ",
        "I thought the trailer looked trash but the reviews convinced me to see it — now I will be evangelizing to all my friends",
        "I really wonder what was going on with those trailers. PTA edited the first one himself most likely, but they both seemed way too cautious about giving any real sense of what the film is about. I do think a different trailer approach gets you another $10M opening, I mean I saw the trailers everywhere, all weekend during NFL games and online.",
        "It’s hard to make a trailer for a Pynchon based novel.",
        "Iirc only two PTA films have been box office successes, and the most successful, There Will Be Blood, took five weeks just to break even. \n\nThe studio plans to keep this thing in theaters for as long as possible. They were banking on around $20million opening weekend and they got it. The bean counters are satisfied with how this movie is doing.",
        "The title may be overselling it (edit: “it” being the box office success not the Oscar chances) but it’s also 3 hours, without superheroes that can be a real challenge\n\nThat said it had an A Cinemascore which is insanely high for this type of movie, I could see that leading to word of mouth and some big legs.\n\nAnd if the political aspect gets picked up in the culture war bullshit it could get a Streisand effect even from a negative backlash.",
        "I saw it, its gonna win. There’s nothing else this year comes close Oscar wise or will",
        "We haven’t see the full slate yet. Hamnet is supposed to be incredible. I do think One Battle After Another will be a contender tho",
        "Hold your final answer until Come See Me in the Good Light comes out",
        "Should it have costed 130m to make? It was so good but I am struggling to understand why it cost 130m.",
        "HEAT cost 60m in 1995, that’s roughly the same once you’ve adjusted for inflation. Shooting on location in California with multiple large, complex action sequences and all-star cast is expensive.",
        "Alot of the budget went to dicaprio and pta too",
        "Expensive cast. Just Leo took 20 millions.",
        "Watching One Battle After Another, I was struck by how much of it reads like a straight-up Christian allegory.\n\nThe Christmas Adventurers feel like the Roman Empire wealthy, dominant, and blind to their own corruption. Lockjaw plays like King Herod, constantly grovelling for Roman approval, desperate to be seen as their equal but never truly accepted. Even the anti-immigration raids echo the suppression of early Christians crushing marginalized groups to maintain control.\n\nBob is raising a child that technically isn't his. \n\nWhen you line it all up, the whole movie starts to look less like a war story and more like a retelling of the New Testament through allegory. Do you think this was intentional, or just an over-interpretation?",
        "Has your landlord turned up? Are you okay?",
        "WE NEED LANDLORD UPDATE",
        "Change your door locks!!",
        "I saw it yesterday and thought it was pretty good especially when compared against the other movies that have been released this year. The only other 2025 movie I liked as much as this one was probably sinners.",
        "I loved the movie (especially the soundtrack) but I dunno if it’s a best picture. Cinematography and score should definitely win though.",
        "He’s been underrated at the Oscars for too long, maybe this is finally his year."

        "Really enjoyed this movie.\n\nKind of an aside, but I noticed that there’s a bit of a disconnect between the people who saw it in theatre vs the people who saw it on streaming.\n\nEveryone I know who saw it on the big screen were impressed by its staging and cinematography, the real sense of movement in the long shots. And a lot of the later discussion i see only ever mentions the plot",
        "I saw it streaming, was impressed by all the things you said, and also thought it was just a fun ride. I went in with zero expectations and zero knowledge of anything about the movie other than “a new PTA film? Have to watch”\n\n¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯",
        "SNL just did a OBAA parody sketch this weekend.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5J5AbdaprU\n\nI thought it was great!",
        "I think that if PTA actually made that happen, a bunch of people would buy those action figures just for the absurdity of it all!",
        "I actually thought it was gonna be an action film 😂 not sure why but the trailers led me down that path. My wife and I definitely went in not expecting this movie and love it. Leo and Sean’s performances were outstanding",
        "I was not ready for dark comedy and everyone handled it well. I only saw at home streaming on computer.  It was really good.",
        "&gt;I actually thought it was gonna be an action film\n\nWait....it wasn't an action film?",
        "There was a lot more action than I was expecting from a PTA film, if including car chases in that category. Part of why I liked so much and was surprised by it. Same with how funny it was at times.",
        "No you don’t understand man you didn’t really see it unless you saw it in 70mm Vistavision, man. Sorry but at home barely counts/s. The format gatekeepers, sheeeeeeesh. Edit: Only part I agree with them about is if you want to pass judgment on something and you watched it while scrolling idgaf what you think",
        "That chase scene on the big screen was something else.",
        "The first 20 minutes with the French 75 were downright hypnotic in theatre",
        "I don’t get carsick and that scene made me carsick. \n\nPTA said he concocted the chase when they were driving around location scouting. He was trying to focus on the landscape out the window and kept getting queasy, so he planned the whole thing around that.",
        "&gt; PTA said he concocted the chase when they were driving around location scouting. He was trying to focus on the landscape out the window and kept getting queasy, so he planned the whole thing around that.\n\nThe Wraith, from 1986, basically has the same sequence as One Battle After Another. &gt;!Rolling up and down southwestern roads, up and down, up and down, then a car sits in the middle of the road just over a hill resulting in a crash.!&lt;\n\nOBAA unquestionably did it better though.",
        "Just drove down a long desert road yesterday that went up and down like the one in the movie.",
        "I didn’t get to see it in theaters. I saw it on streaming. Everyone talked so highly of the chase scene but I was a little let down by it (loved the movie though). Being a cinephile, I just assumed I missed the moment in the theater and that’s why it didn’t land for me. \n\nThat being said, this movie reminds me more of Inherent Vice than any other film in PTA’s filmography. I’m quite surprised with the general reception to the film’s quirkiness, offbeat pacing, and lived-in satire. Funny considering they are both based off Pynchon’s work. \n\nIt took two viewings for this film to “connect” and “resonate” with me beyond its political messaging. I think it’s wonderful that people love this film, but everyone I talk to has a different reason why.",
        "I think most people who stream also are browsing their phone or eating dinner or doing whatever, so a lot of the art that goes into some of these scenes gets missed. \n\nThe chase seen, for example, was an excellent masterclass on build up and payoff. But if you’re tuning in and out you’d probably go “are they still driving? Nothings happening.” You lose that sense of foreboding.\n\nI think a lot of people call this moving boring and too slow of a burn because they aren’t paying attention and miss all the nuances.",
        "That is fair, I watched it at home but treated it like a theater; lights dimmed, no distractions.  If you haven't seen it yet I recommend treating this one like a movie night out at home.",
        "I've been watching movies with my family a lot lately and so often they'll be looking at their phone throughout a movie. Drives me crazy, part of me wants to kind of push them not to do it but I don't want to be annoying. I really do think people get kind of addicted to their phone, not even in a \"doomscrolling 12 hours a day\" kind of way, just in the sense that without thinking they'll subconsciously pull it out. \n\nJust makes such a big difference with how much you'll enjoy a movie, and I'm hesitant to even show them some films (like \"a ghost story\") because I feel like visual movies that have long stretches with minimal dialogue just won't click if you're not paying full attention. \n\nI'm ADHD too, so I do get it, when I first made a rule for myself to not use my phone *at all* during a movie I had to physically put it out of reach.",
        "My wife does this while we watch a show or a movie that we’re supposedly both into. She misses major plot points and constantly asks me to remind her what happened. It drives me bonkers.",
        "You can see this in Mad Men discussion because it's gotten a bit of a resurgence lately. It's a show that really relies on subtext, so there's a new generation of people not understanding the show at all lmao. \n\nAlthough, there were a lot of people who didn't get it when it originally came out too.",
        "I am probably one of those.  It was original, but I didnt get all the hype.  It was just alright story shot well.\n\nThat said, it was long and I watched it after a long day of work so I may give it a fresh set of eyes.",
        "I definitely do feel like the “pictures on a screen” part of film has been losing its relevancy when talking about movies lol",
        "I do not think it deserves best pic at the Oscars (notably the script/dialogue was weak and the pacing was off) but that car chase was easily a top 2 movie scene of the year (sinners I lied to you song being the other).",
        "That makes a lot of sense. I watched it streaming and I don't really get why it's so wildly considered the shoo in for best picture. Don't get me wrong, I was entertained... I don't know how to put it..the character work and morality felt gratuitous to me. I think about the best picture line up in 2014 or 2017 and how I was completely transported by the movies. This one felt like a really enjoyable romp to me. I'm glad it got made. I love quite a lot of the unstated insights we get about the characters. The geographic narrative was a delight. Nonetheless it still felt like huge portions of the film were straight up tawdry, and not in a pearl clutching kind of way, but in a \"what value or ante this even ADD?\" kind of way.",
        "I saw it in a movie theatre. I agree that the cinematography is amazing, but I think that as a whole the movie is bad. \n\nThe greater plot is fine, the acting is very good but I really dislike the script/text.",
        "Also saw it in theaters, and I did actually like it.  But best picture doesn’t make sense to me.",
        "I streamed it last weekend. I didn't like it at all.",
        "I think this is more likely to be something of a sampling issue at this point, honestly.  The people who go to the theaters are just going to put more weight on things like cinematography in general, and will be happy with just having an okay story if it's accompanied by excellent visuals; whereas the average audience wants a more rounded experience.\n\nCertainly for me, the cinematography and directing were amazing, sure, but the script and character work was flat enough that it didn't make up for that.  It was fine, but not the all-rounder that I would expect a Best Picture frontrunner to be.\n\nWhen people(not necessarily you) act like everyone who doesn't see it in theaters isn't \"really\" watching the film ....it just stinks of pretentiousness at this point.",
        "I saw it in IMAX and hated it. Commodifies revolution, disparages revolutionaries, and has the least original plot ever. It looked and felt amazing but it meant nothing. PTA is a great director but GOD did he fumble the themes",
        "I just watched this last night, what a strange movie. There were an insane amount of \"why would that person do that thing\" moments. I only watched because of Leonardo and it definitely is not my favorite Leonardo movie.",
        "There were a bunch of plot holes and loose ends. It started off great and at the end I was like 'wtf'.",
        "Ehh I think I was too stupid to thoroughly appreciate this movie at the level everyone seems to be gushing about it \n\nToo high level for my moleman brain 🧠",
        "[deleted]",
        "I guess you could call it straightforward if you’re talking about, like, a Wikipedia-style summary of the story beats or whatever. (Not that a story needs to be complex to be great.) But in terms of form? And performances? For all their left turns and general quirkiness, PTA’s movies are so artfully classical that I think people mistake his visual style for just business as usual. There’s an interstitial, 10-second shot of Willa in the bleachers that is framed and lit with more gusto than many entire movies from this year. He phones nothing in.",
        "I found this one more straightforward than his other films, but no less enjoyable.",
        "Never forget that media literacy and attention spans are cratering across the board. The fact the person you replied to is enough to even acknowledge that they might not understand it probably puts them above the average who likely missed the points and just ranted about this or that.",
        "It's one of the reasons movie theaters are still great. Unless you are a major asshole you can't second screen at the theater. The movie has all of your attention.",
        "I think a lot of people missed the ways it's actually critical or satirical of revolutionary movements, without condemning them or their participants or saying their concerns aren't warranted, but that's just the usual media literacy issues I guess.",
        "DiCaprio's character after the time jump is pathetic and nearly every scene he's in draws attention to that in some humorous way. People who read the plot summary on Wikipedia and decide this is Hollywood's way of attacking ICE are missing 90% of the movie and 99% of the satire.",
        "100% with you on this - decent movie but not earth shattering. I will say any of the scenes with Benecio Del Toro was top and not over done.",
        "He was honestly my favorite part of the movie (which is saying a lot, because I enjoyed the film).  He stole every scene he was in, I absolutely loved the scene in his apartment with DiCaprio on the phone with Comrade Josh and getting increasingly frustrated over his inability to get even a single, simple answer while Del Toro is just very casually evacuating the people he's hiding and fetching his rifle and whatever else he needs to bug out at a moment's notice.",
        "Love how he seemingly had a six pack of modelo on him at all times. ",
        "Nah it was good, but nothing crazy. You’re fine.",
        "Genuinely wish my media literacy was at a higher level.\n\n Now I think it's gotten better in the last few years but I still have times where I watch a movie and can't piece together what the directors message is. Even when it's obvious",
        "&gt; Genuinely wish my media literacy was at a higher level.\n\nI wish this phrase never entered modern lexicons in 2022. \n\nYou don't need to be any more or less \"media literate,\" and allegories and hidden meanings aren't all equal. You can go through the schools, the books, become published, win awards, and still \"not get\" the attraction or meaning of some critically lauded movies.",
        "&gt;I wish this phrase never entered modern lexicons in 2022\n\nAgreed. It's akin the proliferation of therapy speak.",
        "I agree.\n\nI get the themes and ideas of it, doesn't mean I have to love it as a film.  I still found the characters too shallow, and the opening borderline unnecessary with only a handful of tweaks needed to bring it down from a bloated and obnoxious 30 minutes to maybe around 5 at most.",
        "If it makes you feel better, there is a lot of discussion among critics and online about what the film is actually trying to say. It's not clear cut.",
        "Interesting I can't imagine the movie being more clear. It's a satire of the right and authoritarianism while also pointing out even the most extreme resistance is just swallowed up by the machine with only minor changes coming from it.\n\nThere is a reason Penn's character straight up says he doesn't give a fuck about them blowing up banks and courthouses it won't change anything. And he was right for all the deaths and shit the French 75 never seem to have changed anything about the structure in place. Doesn't mean that resistance is useless but it's not going to be wrapped up quickly.\n\nBob and his daughter's story is just another tale of resistance and a coming of age story for her",
        "(while also pointing out even the most extreme resistance is just swallowed up by the machine with only minor changes coming from it.)\n\nSee I thought something similar. But the Sensei character, who is also a revolutionary, does bring *genuine* change for many people. It's well organized and we see maybe a hundred or so people that are helped by his organization.",
        "I think the movie is trying to send multiple messages, and condensing it down into one overarching theme would be reductive.",
        "I think the fact that you’re willing to say ‘I don’t get it’ and look at discussions at least makes you more media literate than the general population lol",
        "Yeah I've started to just say, \" I don't get it \" or \" media literacy diff \" alot more. I used to want to get everything but now if I don't get it, I'll do some research about the movie online and leave it at that. Maybe it'll change my feelings, maybe it won't",
        "You’re unironically being media literate when you realize you don’t understand something and try to look it up lol.\n\nThere’s just too much stuff to “get” everything. There’s definitely movies that I’ve watched because their classics or considered really important that I didn’t understand until I read about them after.",
        "&gt; I'll do some research about the movie\n\nToo many people--not you, well, probably not you--think that movie reviews are worthless because \"I don't agree with how the reviewer liked / didn't like the movie\". A person doesn't have to agree with the movie reviewer. The reviewer is a professional critic, meaning they have seen hundreds or even thousands of films with perhaps a background in film history, or an MFA, or something similar. Their perspective is of course going to be different, and a reader doesn't have to agree. The review is there to compare and contrast the film with other works by the same director, or others in the same genre. It's there to give context, or even to provide a different viewpoint.\n\nI love reading movie reviews. They open my eyes to something I didn't see, and can even help me appreciate a film more, or less.",
        "To each their own and all that but I personally felt kinda meh about this movie especially given how much people were gushing about it. It felt like it had a first act then a long second first act then it was ending. Even Leo’s robe was a self contained metaphor for the movie’s mediocrity; I was waiting for him to change out of the robe when the film hit it’s stride and he just never did",
        "He's not a hero tho, things happen by \"doers\" around him. I don't think he steps out of his mediocrity? He has no effect on the outcome of things.",
        "Yeah, i like that he's just kind of a slightly useful fuck-up that everyone (friend and foe alike) assume is more dangerous and capable than he really is. Penn's character, too, come to think of it. Both characters are mediocre men who rose above their stations by riding the coattails of someone else who did all the real work.",
        "I'm so confused at why people aren't talking more about how unnecessary that first act was.\n\nIt does literally nothing past the first scene of them declaring themselves, that couldn't have been served by some minor script tweaks.   Even Perfidia ratting on everyone, by FAR the biggest reason to continue seeing their story past that first hit given virtually everyone else is killed or immediately captures at the start of the second act, is a Chekhov's Gun that just sits on the shelf ornamentally.",
        "I’m right there with you. Saw it in theaters and was so underwhelmed. It just felt so pointless. And like two good half stories mismatched into one, there was no cohesiveness. I’d rather have just watched a whole movie about Leo’s life as a rebel.",
        "honestly the rebel/revolutionary part was the least interesting to me.  leo/bob struggling to do anything while a military group is closing in on him....   good shit",
        "Nah, it misfires in many small ways. There's barely any character development. DiCaprio and Penn's acting is kind of annoying. Everything is a bit oddly silly but the tone of the movie as a whole doesn't really fit with that. There's only a minimum of plot, not enough really.\n\nIt's well shot, and the pace is quite good considering it was quite long but didn't feel like it, but I actually didn't like it much.",
        "It’s genuinely nothing to do with the film. The whole thing was just shallow satire; there were no deep profound messages. If people were being honest with themselves, it’s probably in the bottom 3 when compared against PTA’s other films.\n\nDiscourse around media has just turned into some sort of proxy war. Is Sinners the greatest movie ever made is history? No - it isn’t even better than the film it was inspired by. Nothing rational matters anymore, the only thing that matters are optics.\n\n‘Online film critics society’ is painfully appropriate.",
        "what movie was the inspiration?",
        "&gt; The whole thing was just shallow satire; there were no deep profound messages.\n\nI read some discussions where people were asking what the deep part of this movie is and my reaction to all the answers was the same: it's not in the movie. People are talking about message and themes that are simply not explored by movie at all.\n\nCartoonish Sean Pean character or the white racist club were so over the top I cannot take them seriously. Mother character could be exploration of dealing with betrayal, abandonment and handling guit but nah. She is not in the movie after the initial setup. Dicaprio character starts as aloof fool and ends in the same way. \n\nThere is more depth in the There Will be Blood baptism scene than in this entire movie.",
        "Why is Benicio del Toro nominated for an Oscar for his role in this?\n\nI thought it it was a fine, low key and not noteworthy performance and role in the film, but I would never guess it would be nominated for an Oscar.",
        "I loved his zen nature through all the chaos. But I don't get the Oscar nomination either. \n\nLeo's nomination isn't intuitive for me either. He does a great job, and I love this performance - I just don't see why it's Oscar worthy. I think he did an even better job in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.",
        "I didn't think it was that good.",
        "This was a great movie. Makes me want read the book that inspired it.",
        "Vineland is VERY different, just warn you, but very good. Pynchon is a very intelligent and playful writer, but his bizarro universe and meandering writing style is not everyone's cup.\n\nIf you give it a shot, just remember that the digressions are the story, not the plot.",
        "Do it, Pynchon is excellent (and he has much better books than Vineland)",
        "I think people approach Pynchon's novels thinking they are very literary and then get shocked when they slowly realize how wacky his novels are. Like, Gravity's Rainbow has a sentient lightbulb and a ... food fight. Vineland has ninjas, UFOs and Godzilla. His new novel Shadow Ticket has a vampire biker gang lol.",
        "Some of his writing is like a high quality shit post at times, or just like pages and pages of build up for a one line pun. He tells such fun stories and doesn’t take himself seriously",
        "Plus there’s an unexpected amount of well-constructed references to/explanations of concepts from math, science, and engineering that show he's got a pretty deep understanding of the material. Pynchon’s got that polymath thing going on.",
        "But they ARE literary. They're just very playful as well. Pynchon is one of a kind.",
        "And a golem with a machine gun arm who fights said gang",
        "We spend way more time with Zoyd (Bob in the movie) and his daughter in the book than we ever do in the movie.\n\n\nOne poignant scene that I'm bummed PTA did not include in the film has Zoyd placing his little girl atop a glass cage and she's all happy and he tells her, \"Enjoy it while the glass can still hold your weight\". Such an amazing scene that would've elevated the film further had PTA included it in the film.\n\n\nDo know this -- Zoyd sort of disappears in the middle portion of the book. However, we do get UFOs and ... Godzilla. Still Pynchon's most normal novel tho.",
        "According to people who claimed to have attended the test screenings, there was something UFO-related in earlier cuts of OBAA.",
        "I seem to have lost the track on what makes a film good.  Cause this movie seemed like a very messy and erratic attempt at extremely broad satire.",
        "The movie “critic” version of yelp reviewers on South Park?",
        "It didn't click for me. Cardboard characters, terrible use of music, empty dialogue and such forced attempts at making memorable speeches. Trying too hard, failing even harder, wannabe artistic (what foreign films have been doing for the past 50+ years, but now that it's American all of the sudden it's good and artistic). \n\nUnpopular opinion I guess, but one of the most overrated movies of recent times.",
        "Yes I agree. For anyone else reading this thread thinking they are about to watch a masterpiece, be very warned... I thought the movie was pretty ty terrible. I found basically every single character to be unlikable and the climax is one of the most unbelievable bits of storytelling I've seen in a long time.\n\nThis movie is being propped up by being partly a political commentary.",
        "I didn't really get it, personally. Was just ok.",
        "I thought Bugonia was much better.",
        "This movie was just OK for me.  PTA sure likes his weird villains, but I feel like he'll forever be chasing Daniel Plainview.  You can't top that milkshake.  OBAA is probably just OK to me because I might be the only movie watcher in the world that is tired of Leo playing basically the same sorta guy, just with different facial hair. He's never bad, just too familiar for me.",
        "Cinephiles are absolutely over exaggerating about how good this movie is. This movie is okay, not great. Sinnners is the better and more entertaining movie.",
        "My general impression after seeing this movie was, \"Of all the Paul Thomas Anderson movies I've seen, this was certainly one of them.\" It wasn't bad, it was...fine. And I'm a PTA fan. The acting was good, I guess.",
        "I think they are a lock for best picture and best director at this point. ",
        "This movie sucked hard. Plot was pointless. Dialogue felt so forced (\"look at how quirky we are!\").\n\nOh and then they try and redeem the mother at the end? lame.",
        "Didn't care for the movie at all. Trying to pay homage or pastiche classic 1960/70s counterculture with no thought on how to fit it in with the modern era. It's like he wanted to adapt Elmore Leonard but picked up the wrong book.",
        "This movie was like a 5/10. I wanted to like it, love Leonardo films typically. But man, the plot and messaging were just…sort of dumb. What revolution are they fighting exactly? Are we supposed to like these people? They robbed a bank and they kill innocent people. How are they not terrorists? I can get behind a movement if I understand what they are fighting for, what their goal is, and how they win. But none of this is identified. We are left to wonder…which is fine, I guess, but it made the characters hard to empathize with.\n\nI thought the daughter did a great job in the movie.",
        "I thought the whole point was that everybody sucks lol\n\nEveryone is a caricature of a person"

        "It was powerful five minutes though",
        "I thought Penn was a lot more impactful and disappeared into the character, Benicio is always good I just never saw Penn do anything like that.",
        "The minute he got it up i was hooked \n\nHes so fucking good",
        "tbf Sean Penn wasn't a support, he was a main character together with Leo, so it's Dicaprio over Sean Penn.",
        "National Board of Review Winners 2025:\n\n* Best Film: One Battle After Another\n\n* Best Director: Paul Thomas Anderson, One Battle After Another\n\n* Best Actor: Leonardo DiCaprio, One Battle After Another\n\n* Best Actress: Rose Byrne, If I Had Legs I’d Kick You\n\n* Best Supporting Actor: Benicio Del Toro, One Battle After Another\n\n* Best Supporting Actress: Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, Sentimental Value\n\n* Best Directorial Debut: Eva Victor, Sorry, Baby\n\n* Breakthrough Performance: Chase Infiniti, One Battle After Another\n\n* Best Original Screenplay: Ryan Coogler, Sinners\n\n* Best Adapted Screenplay: Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar, Train Dreams\n\n* Best Animated Feature: Arco\n\n* Best International Film: It Was Just an Accident\n\n* Best Documentary: Cover-Up",
        "Sean Penn not getting best supporting actor is honestly insane. What he did with Lockjaw was easily the best performance I've seen in years. Del Toro's character was fun, and likeable, but there's not much to it",
        "I loved Penn's performance &amp; would've also been happy with him winning too, but I thought Benicio's character,  through his demeanor and actions, embodies the spirit of the film (around its themes around being selfless and protecting your community at all costs) throughout the 2nd act, while he doesn't overshadow Leo &amp; the other leads in other parts (moreso his charisma helps elevate Leo's performance heading into the climax)",
        "Lockjaw is such a classic bad guy though. And he wore that character's malice and cruelty with such distinctive aplomb..I honestly don't think anyone else could do it justice the way he did. His awkward herky-jerky mannerisms.. that low growl of \"fake tough guy\" . Just look at the internal conflict he demonstrates in his scenes with Willa.. clearly going back and forth on his feelings. You almost feel sorry for him as soon as you swing back to despising him. That's hard to do",
        "Remove or replace the karate teacher and the movie will still work, but be worse overall and less fun. Remove or replace the bad guy and you are left with nothing. His acting is what makes the story work.",
        "I’m okay with it because Del Toro’s part is an actual supporting role",
        "Sounds like something a “semen demon” would say",
        "Lockjaw to me was really the core character of the entire film. I can think of few villains who manage to elicit so much pity and sympathy from the viewer despite being the bad guy. Even Penn’s facial tics were completely dialed in.",
        "Lockjaw was a great character but I felt zero pity or sympathy for him. In fact, he was so evil and revolting I felt my blood boiling just watching him on screen. I’m not sure how you had any sympathy for him",
        "Yeah I felt like the point the movie was making with him was that even though the French 75 was deeply flawed and made of imperfect individuals, the other side (Lockjaw and the Christmas Adventurers) are literally the devil",
        "Yea wtf lol. “I felt so much pity and and sympathy for the virulent racist who is having a hard time joining a secret cabal or racists but the brown people wont just be chill and let him do his thing”",
        "I wouldn’t say I felt sympathy, but seeing his confusion, insecurities, and self-loathing consume him, I definitely pitied him. I hated him for how he acted on those emotions too.",
        "I wonder if a lot of people really don't want Penn to win a 3rd Oscar despite having massive amount of acclaim for this movie. That would put him in rare tier of actors like Jack Nicholson and DDL.",
        "I do think a greater part of “Sensei” (I just realized I don’t remember his actual name at all) is brought by Del Toro. There’s very little to that character that’s actually in the script.\n\nThat being said, Penn was absolutely phenomenal. I feel like tour de force is overused, but his portrayal of Lockjaw really was that.",
        "[deleted]",
        "Seeing that he's basically designed as a caricature to represent current day America I'm ok with him being over the top",
        "I get it. Many people always look to the big and showy performances as the “best” but many others prefer smaller, subtler performances.",
        "100% Penn was incredible in this and del toro just played another typical del toro role.",
        "I fully agree. I do think that Del Toro had a lot to say about how his character turned out, that might have helped. That being said, Sean Penn likely had a lot to say as well.",
        "THANK YOU SENSEI",
        "So glad to see Victor got picked for Sorry, Baby. I just watched it last night and was blown away, surprised that I haven’t seen more conversation about it.",

        "[deleted]",
        "I hope this movie gets rereleased soon with all of the award buzz. It was at my local theater for less than 1 week, 2 screenings a day Friday-Wednesday. Very frustrating.",
        "What’s annoying is that the movie is hitting a level of acclaim now where having balanced discourse around it is functionally impossible.\n\nThe popularity tax is real.",
        "I don’t know if we’re there yet because I don’t think this movie was super popular despite being one of PTA’s best performing movies. \n\nMost of the “controversial” discussions I’ve seen are really about a certain character’s ending, and whether it was cheap or not",
        "To me, the only part that fell flat was the ending. &gt;!After all the kinds of revolutionary actions committed by the French 75, and the sensei’s organized support of the outcasts in his community, seeing Charlene take up the mantle by going to a protest felt very underwhelming. Like protests are fine and all, but seem really tepid and superficially impactful relative to the revolutionary spirit of the film.!&lt;",
        "She has to start somewhere. She didn’t grow up with and wasn’t influenced by the French 75 as a kid. Also, she grew up with one parent that in my opinion wasn’t all that personally invested in what the French 75 was about. Leo’s character was there because he was smitten with and followed Perfidia to where she was, not because he himself was a revolutionist. If Charlene grew up with Perfidia, then that’s another story.",
        "I didn’t get the vibe that Leo was in it just for Perfidia. He seemed very passionate about his beliefs, especially considering his conversation with his daughter’s teacher towards the beginning.",
        "I dunno. It felt clear to me that &gt;! she was carrying on the spirit of revolution. If you view the film as an allegory of the fight for the soul of America that is literally happening today, the main character’s decision to protest is also her decision to choose democracy over fascism. It’s a hopeful display that indicates there is a real way forward which is both nonviolent and righteous. !&lt;",
        "to me, that was the whole point of the film. the story was a cautionary tale about Perfidia's lack of balance around her ideology, her selfishness, and her extreme anger. \n\nher daughter started to follow a much healthier path, where she doesn't shut everyone around her out and make a political mission her whole existence in life.",
        "The movie pretty much spells it out when Jungle Pussy is doing her whole \"This gun is my power\" speech and then everything goes wrong when Perfidia actually uses that power.",
        "I think that's fair but &gt;!I felt like the protest was a middle ground between the extremism of the French 75 and the community engagement of the sensei. Like, you can say what you want about a protest's effectiveness alone, but they're also one of the places where community leaders gather and can engage people in the community directly who aren't already tapped in. I can see why people think protests are weak or they don't work, but those going to a protest often don't only JUST go to protests. Also, if things get violent, the sensei showed that it helps having people there who are capable.!&lt;\n\nI can see why you would think it was a little lame though, since that stuff isn't explicitly in the movie though.",
        "Sensei did a lot more than community engagement. In fact I think the movie was saying something about understated people like him who don't make a show of their political activism. He quietly protects his community, keeps hundreds of immigrants safe, and protects a revolutionary at his own cost - all while expecting nothing in return. Arguably, he was more effective and safe than the French 75.",
        "Suffering from success smh.",
        "Don’t worry the pendulum will swing the other way eventually, happens to literally anything popular",
        "Yeah it always happens with highly-acclaimed movies and it kinda sucks. This is why I kind of dreaded Anora winning best picture last year, because I thought it would prompt a ton of backlash (though most people who didn't like it seemed to move on). Boyhood is another one, where the effusive critical praise made it hard to just enjoy as a Linklater movie, because it brought the attention of so many haters.",

        "Genuine question bc I'm curious: for the people saying OBAA is overrated, did you see it opening weekend with a crowd or at home on TV, alone, after hearing about all the positive reviews? The latter tends to lead to a lot of hate for high praise blockbusters in my experience (Weapons and Sinners too, for example)",
        "I saw it in a crowded theater, IMAX. Thought it was mid and not sure what the hype is about",
        "This phenomenon applies a lot more to Sinners and Weapons than it does this.",
        "My wife was out of town so I went to see it by myself opening night in IMAX. I enjoyed it, but am surprised by the hype. In 5 years time, I don’t think I’ll remember this film, but I will definitely remember Bugonia.",
        "Saw it in a theater totally blind and was pretty shocked at the overwhelmingly positive reception. I don't think it's trash but I don't think it's particularly great; it was an enjoyable but hollow experience overall. Not a movie I think there's much value in watching a second time, and one that is politically impotent despite its set dressing. Not the best work of any of the marquee careers nor a movie that I expect to have any staying power.      \n\n\nPersonally I felt that the time skip hampered everything, that the movie got to skip over all its character development in a huge cut forward. In other movies PTA wouldn't have done that: Boogie Nights doesn't skip right to the cocaine, TWBB doesn't skip right to the downfall, we see the characters pressed by shifting times and circumstances. In OBAA I felt like all the juicy parts were skipped by and the movie is weaker for it. \n  ",

        "I assume you're talking about OBAA. Reddit seems to love it. Go over to r/Oscarrace, it's the favorite to sweep awards. Check out r/boxoffice, they love the performance. Also in terms of popularity=hate OBAA is the 28th most popular movie in the US this year. Sinners is 5th and I haven't seen much dislike for that. Ditto for Weapons at 15th.

        "Not sure I would say it was her acting, but the performance was just so laughably over the top that it almost takes you out of the movie in my opinion. Maybe it was meant to be that way, but even after she’s gone I never really cared about the daughter or what happened to her.

        "He is seriously underrated as a comedic actor. I don’t think I realized just how funny he is until this movie, but you can see it in movies like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Wolf of Wall Street; I had previously just given credit to the scripts, but he’s got some comedic chops.",

I was self-conscious about whether I was supposed to find it funny or if it was offensive to laugh.",

        "Sean Penn coming back as the terminator just to say he was reversed raped by a semen demon had me cackling",
        "His face being fucked up as he gave that reasoning was the cherry on top",
        "Looking like that and going “oh mommy” when they told him he was “in” killed me lol",
        "I did wonder about the reasoning for bringing him back just to kill him off, given both times he is killed by the Christmas adventurers.\n\nIt might be to do with the fact that despite his attempt to be macho (the lifts lol) he essentially just takes orders and is used by various actors, the military, then he's essentially subdued Perfidia despite his allegiance to the military, then he's subdued by the adventurers despite is allegiance to Perfidia. He is a fair weather friend who never actually gets what he desires - or he thinks he does for about 5 seconds",
        "I think it’s (quite transparently, tbh) to cement his pathetic nature, that he values the “honor” of this stupid club far higher than even his own self-respect. Even after the Xmas Adventurers Club tried to kill him and permanently disfigured his face, he still came crawling back to redeem the glory of a shitty corner office in Sacramento.",
        "To further that, any sane person would be tipped off by the office being more or less barren that something was off but Lockjaw is too craven and solitary in pursuit of the goal he's deluded enough to think he's obtained that all he can do is kick his feet up in \"victory\"",
        "That moment drove home how pathetic he was. That bare, soulless office was his El Dorado hahaha",
        "They had to really drive home the “these are Nazis” bit by having them gas and incinerate him.",
        "I'm so stupid for not getting that despite how Nazi they felt the whole time. \n\n\nWas too busy laughing at his face. ",
        "That car chase was filmed in such a bonkers way. I felt like I was on a rollercoaster. I didn't think there was an original way to show a car chase in a movie but PTA somehow did it.",
        "It was Hitchcock like imo. We enjoy the aesthetic aspect of the scene but subliminally wonder where is this going? Only to fuse the aesthetic form into the narrative and cause the climactic crash. Very clever.",
        "Yes! It had a total Hitchcock vibe to it. The shots of the undulating road with the cars dipping in and out of view, the tension hanging as we wait to see if the pursuer is coming around the bend - heavy suspense elements that feel like something of a modern North by Northwest scene.",
        "Absolutely, you can see Willa’s thought process when she saw the waves on the road.",
        "“Ocean waves”",
        "After 2 minutes of watching the second car get closer, then there’s a turn in the road a 3rd car appears felt like I took a shot of cocaine",
        "Benicio Del Toro's character is the greatest street-level superhero ever for having such an intricate system to protect his community, having some skater ninjas as part of his squad, &amp; even having nurses holding shit down for him\n\nThe guy who Lockjaw handed Willa to gave me strong Hanzee from Fargo vibes when he ended up saving her",
        "When he did the little dance when being stopped by police, that made me laugh",
        "Even though this movie doesn't really need a sequel, I wouldn't mind a film set in the same universe with him helping out another revolutionary",
        "When he said 8:19 i thought \"oh shit he is part of the French 75!\"  \n\nThen I realized he was just telling him the time.",
        "Him saying \"It's 8:15\" was, for me, likely the funniest little moment in the whole movie.",
        "His vibes were immaculate. Love that he didn’t question anything and was just 100% prepared to help out Bob on an absolute whim",
        "He is so good, you instantly believe his authority and gentle command. Excellent casting, excellent performance.",
        "Bob missing the jump between the two buildings is the hardest I’ve laughed at the movies in years",
        "Idk why, but even him suddenly crawling on the floor at Sensei's dojo when a police car passed by made me laugh a little too",
        "I nearly pissed myself when he says \"don't get paranoid\" and takes one last puff of his little roach",
        "It took me a second to register. At first I assumed it was some parkour shit the skater kids were doing, then he face planted on the cement.  \n\nFucking Gringo Zapata",
        "God what an immaculately paced movie",
        "Felt half an hour shorter than it was",
        "I’m not sure I’ve ever seen another movie paced this well. Fastest almost 3 hours of my life",
        "Love everything with Sensei . I know many Tios like him that will help you no questions asked. I love the contrast between the racist and revolutionaries too . All the bs with code words and proving yourself . Meanwhile Sensei helped Bob on sight. Even while dealing with his own crisis he made sure Bob was cool , calm , and collected (always made sure he had a Modelo in hand 🤣) . No one in his family / community even questioned Bob just greeted and helped.",
        "Yesssss. Sensei was all the old heads that wouldn't call themselves revolutionaries or activists, but they're doing the on the ground work because that's just what you do.",
        "That Modelo product placement was top tier marketing. I don’t drink anymore but I feel like next time I’m doing some revolutionary shit I’m going to need to crack a few.",
        "Do you mean… a coupla small beers",
        "Yeah it felt like the movie was trying to say A LOT of political things but what I got most from it was Mexicans are the best.",
        "\"I'm Batman... I'm Peter Parker.\" This might be the most thoroughly cooked character Leonardo DiCaprio has played.",
        "He was so unhinged during his interaction with Willa's friend &amp; shaking him down lol",

        "Sean Penn deserves an Oscar for this film. He's on another level of weird and vile in this.\n\n\nDo NOT wait to stream this, go watch it in theater.",
        "I don't think he was acting. I think that's just how Sean Penn is.",
        "He was so menacing when he was saying to Chase that just because he wears tight shirts doesn’t mean he’s gay. Which was also a very funny interaction",
        "“I’m not gay,” says the man who constantly walks like he has something up his ass.",
        "That damn weird mouth mannerisms gave me the creeps",
        "The comb thing in the lift was psychotic",
        "I loved that the assassin from the Christmas Adventurers was wearing a red Lacoste shirt with the green alligator. Fuckin hilarious",
        "The whole persona of all the villains was very much suburban golf dad and I loved it.",
        "That motherfucker was the worst assassin of all time. Was told to \"do it clean\"; blams his target in the face with a shotgun and sends his car flying off the side of the road. Lazily checks the wreckage - doesn't finish the job. Gets dropped by a teenager in the middle of nowhere. F minus, not worthy of Saint Nicholas by any means.",
        "The \"what time is it?\" exchanges were so damn hilarious. It was already working the first time, but bringing it up in Sergio's place made it even better.",
        "\"Time does not exist, yet it controls us.\"\n\n\"OH FUUUUUCK YOUU\"",
        "Honestly I had the same thought as soon as he said it. I also loved Sergio just saying 8:15 (assuming that was the actual time then) and the LOST fan in me wish that had been the actual answer",
        "Thank God for the French 75 member who was lenient enough to provide the secret question to Bob of what his favorite type of pussy is to provide coordinates to find Willa lol",
        "The way I CACKLED and the white supremacist meeting when the dude was like “oh, no more pussy”",
        "This to me was the most \"topical\". The fact that the people in power were such pathetic losers. \"Hail St Nick!!!\" Fuck you.",
        "Great sequence. I wondered if it was making a point about the old v new revolutionaries with the dude on the phone talking about \"noise triggers\" and \"invading my space\" etc",
        "That was definitely the intent. Tone policing “revolutionaries” that are overly focused on theory and not praxis.\n\nIt’s also intentional that it’s some white geek named Josh and all the minorities are immediately recognizing and accepting of Bob.",
        "Sean Penn’s face when he read “this pussy don’t pop for you” told me I was in for a great time.",
        "That whole short scene coming up to that as well. When she didn't answer I at first thought he was going back to drive away after he left the flowers but then saw the battering ram. Lol.",
        "The character that most stuck with me was Danvers, the government guy who was doing all the interrogations and threatening people for information. He had such a benignly evil and calculated presence that made those scenes feel so real.\n\nSurprise surprise when I look up the actor and see this is his second film credit after spending 20 years as a Homeland Security Agent. No wonder he was such a natural, he'd probably used those tactics on tons of people in the field. Not sure if he's trying to make up for past sins or he just didn't understand what the movie was going for, either way he made an impression I guess.",
        "\"Do I look like one of your parents?\"  Bluto - \"Yeah Kinda\"",
        "Bluto was so chill",
        "Yeah no shade on the rest of the cast but they were more cartoonish compared to how real Danvers felt. That cold blooded delivery when he was talking with Regina hall made my blood boil.",
        "Three-car chase scene at the end was crazy good on screen. \n\nLove the music. \n\nLove Chase Infiniti’s performance the most. Insane that this is her debut. \n\nVery funny at times too.",
        "What a fucking face melter of a movie.\nUnbelievably strong performances from everyone basically- but I want to single out Regina Hall, who is so so good here with such a small role. She was probably my standout honestly, which is wild to say in a movie with so many excellent turns. \n\nLeo pulling my favorite GTA move and driving away to close the car door when he took the purple car put a huge smile on my face. Honestly, this felt perfect. 10/10",
        "All the car chase scenes felt like GTA honestly especially the overhead shot in ~~DTLA~~ Sacramento when they were chasing down Perfidia",
        "The entire middle hour from where Leo goes through the tunnel to falling off the roof and getting arrested might be my favorite film making in a decade. The piano key for almost 45 minutes straight of anxiety. \n\nRealizing how wild sensi is. Him trying to charge his phone. Falling off the roof. \n\nAnxiety inducing and hysterical. \n\nFirst 10/10 of the year for me. Phenomenal. \n\nSean Penn stole the show as well. His walk is fucking amazing",
        "I AM A CHRISTMAS ADVENTURER",
        "That \"all hail Saint Nick\" salute they had at the end of their meeting felt like something Bill Hader would've wrote in Barry for another criminal group",
        "You’ll never convince me Sean Penn didn’t have something lodged in his anus through the entire performance. From the way he walked to always being on the verge of tears.",
        "“I was reverse raped” dudes will do ANYTHING but admit they like chocolate lmao",
        "It's also the use of the word \"reverse\" to protect his fragile masculinity. Men can't be real raped, it's rape, but you know, not in the way a woman can get raped",
        "“Sounds like a black girl’s name” is fucking crazy",
        "The line straight after, \"do you like black girls? *I fucking love em*\" with Leo just staring into the distance after was so fucking good",
        "The fact that this was Leo and Sean Penn’s only scene together is crazy",
        "The part where members of the French 75 get picked off one by one was so shocking, I was pretty invested already but once all that happened I was locked in for the next 2 hours. Insane movie",
        "Yeah when they blew Alana Haim’s brains out and burned Wood Harris alive I figured we were in for some serious shit",
        "The Alana Haim death scene in IMAX gave me a bigger jump scare than any horror movie this year, that was wild",
        "Greenwood's score was fantastic, especially during that chase scene. It added so much to the tension and catharsis. He better get that Oscar.\n\nAlso, it's crazy that this is Chase Infiniti's film debut. Everyone did a great job but she absolutely killed it, especially during that interrogation scene with Penn or when she had DiCaprio at gunpoint in the highway. She's got a bright future ahead of her.",
        "I was like \"oh fuck\" when the lightbulb went off in her mind with the scheme she made on the road to catch the assassin off-guard and kill him\n\nShe was badass in that scene",
        "Leo plummeting off the building and bouncing off the tree to then only get tasered like 20 seconds later had me cackling so hard haha.\n\nSeen this twice now and think it's an incredible film that absolutely lives up to the hype.\nIts an absolute blast of a film that just flies by in no time.The incredible score from Johnny Greenwood paired with a propulsive pace that's constantly on the move but never feeling overwhelming makes this such an exhilarating watch.\n\nFor as tense as the film can be there's so much hilarious stuff in here too. Stuff like \"why is your shirt so tight\" , leo arguing on the phone and everything to do with Sean Penn is just too funny.\nSpecial props to Chase Infiniti too who in her film debut absolutely owns it amongst these powerhouse actors. Definitely one to watch.\n\nExhilarating stuff and honestly my favourite film of the year so far.",
        "Leo was incredible, got lost in the role. You expect him to go superhero at some point but he just stays desperate dad trying to save his daughter",
        "I really love that Benecio del Toro's character just entirely has his own thing going on. He seems to admire the French 75 and is happy to help Bob but there's a whole other struggle going on.",
        "I felt like we were supposed to see Sensei as doing the real, quiet, slow work, *really* helping people, while Bob and the French 75 were blowing shit up and fucking back in the day until things got real, then they fucked off to the redwoods and became stoners. Sensei is the real war hero, even though fewer people may know him than \"Ghetto Pat\".",
        "“Make it clean. We should all be able to eat off the floor, it’s that clean.”\n\nWhat an absolutely stunning movie. I have a lot to say but no notes, this thing is wonderful from front to back. Leo in manic loser dad mode, a score that moves you through three hours of encroaching military melodrama so beautifully, insanely well cast, and all of that PTA quality in a narrative-driven action film that never loses your attention. PTA hasn’t made a film set in the present day in almost 25 years and it turns out he’s got some things to say about the state of things and I was hanging on every word. \n\nThe opening prologue is pretty masterful in itself. A scene-to-scene montage of youth, rebellion, revolution, horniness, bad decisions, and being thrown into adulthood. Leo is ready to hang up his revolutionary hat when the baby arrives, but it’s not so easy for Teyanah. And for how complex the feelings and the sexual affairs are in this montage you feel it all because that score is so pervasive, it guides you through all of these feelings without ever taking a breath. I’ve seen this twice and the second time this prologue was so much more powerful knowing the context of the movie. Knowing that Perfidia only did what she did because it was the only option to ever see her daughter again. Knowing that when she’s pregnant and drunk by the campfire, Leo and Regina are realizing they’re the ones that are going to have to be there for the baby all her life. Also how kind of how deeply sad Lockjaw is when he arrives at Perfidia’s house with flowers and she isn’t there.\n\nFrom there we fast-forward 16 years and the movie notes that not much has changed. This is also referenced later when Perfidia says that her revolution failed, and not to get too far ahead but this is such a beautifully hopeful movie. Even though there’s so much military oppression and racism, and even though it feels like this movie is all about how exhausting revolution is and how you might have to grow out of it at some point, the ending doesn’t nullify that revolution. It’s about raising the next generation to take on the fight because the oppressive powers that be also see this as a generational game. It’s an extremely powerful and upbeat ending to a movie that has shown literal ICE camps and military fascism. \n\nAnyways, fast-forward 16 years and you get the most perfect needle drop of all time for a movie about a washed-up stoner dad; Dirty Work by Steely Dan. Leo is so incredible in this movie, he’s been really stuck on older losers for the last few movies but this is one for the books. He’s a former revolutionary that’s lost all of his juice to drugs and alcohol and trying to keep it together as a single dad. One of the most relatable scenes of all time is when he’s getting high and watching The Battle of Algiers when he gets the most important call of his life and he can’t remember all the codes, and from there he is a completely manic mess this entire movie. I’ve been likening this movie to Kill Bill but the hilarious turn, of course, is that Ghetto Pat is no Beatrix Kiddo. \n\nHe’s almost completely useless this entire movie, constantly reacting and never planning, and it’s only by the grace of those around him who have stayed sharp and kept fighting that he succeeds. But that’s where the real juice of this movie is, that’s what makes this journey so god damn endearing. He doesn’t know what he’s doing or how he’s going to do it, but he shows up. And that’s what being a dad is, it’s showing up and doing your best. The journey of this movie is Charlene going from “Love you, Bob” to “I Love you, Dad.” and it broke me down like crazy in those final scenes. This whole movie is a struggle between two dads, obviously we never root for Lockjaw but you see all the differences in what makes them a real dad and a bio dad. \n\nI don’t really have time to get into ALL the things I loved about this movie but I do have to mention Benicio Del Toro. In a movie with three incredible lead performances, Benicio is a beautifully unsung hero. I think this movie is talking a lot about how exhausting revolution can be. Leo opted out once he had a daughter and I think there’s a small implication that once he was just a white single dad he fell out of the fight because he simply didn’t have to fight every day. But all the POCs in this movie seem to be in the fight forever without a choice. The nuns are exhausted, Benicio looks like a haggard business owner, but they don’t have the same option to stop fighting. And the way Benicio is just lowkey pounding Modelos and running this underground railroad and has an entire network of admins and laborers is such a great touch. He has endless patience for Leo and all his fuckups because he knows he’s on the right side but this fight never ends for some people in this country. There's a great theme here to how the Christmas Adventurers (funniest fucking thing btw) control all these systemically racist systems but they still use POCs as their workforce and mercenaries and that's where they fail. \n\nLook, I’ll wrap this up, but GOD this just hit every single one of my buttons. Not only is this a great rumination on oppressive right-wing control and all the feelings that come with being a parent or perhaps even a child born into context you had no control over, it’s also a hilarious action film. There are some action scenes in this that truly blew my mind, especially the bank robbery getaway. Some of those car crashes felt so insanely real, I could feel PTA had been wanting to make a movie with this many collisions for a long time and he absolutely nailed it. Between that and laughing out loud at Leo getting tased after trying to follow a bunch of youths across building tops and Benicio showing up to give him a Modelo and take a selfie, I was just in hog heaven with this movie. I haven’t even gotten into how amazing Sean Penn, Regina Hall, Chase Infiniti, even the interrogator guy was incredible. This movie absolutely rocks and is the second 10/10 for me this year next to Sinners. \n\nTHANK YOU SENSEI. VIVA LA REVOLUCION!\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner\n\n[My Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/3TAP)",
        "Love that his name is Lockjaw and he never stops moving his jaw/face around",
        "\nIt’s interesting to me that this was really a film about community, and how we fight to get into and stay within, or protect our communities. There’s the obvious revolutionary group, and then there’s supremacists but then there’s the group Sensei takes care of and even while he’s busy helping one group, he’s willing to help someone else without fully knowing what’s going on. He’s just like hey, let me give you a hand. \n\nIt is funny too how Lockjaw was willing to kill and ruin lives, just so he could “belong” to a place where he wasn’t even wanted. And in contrast, the people whose lives he was ruining, they themselves would’ve been willing to embrace him had he not been a POS.\n\nI really loved the action, the comedy and the pacing of this movie. Sean Penn did great, and the score was really fun too. \n\nThis is one of my favorites of the year.",
        "Loved the running gag(?) of not a single car door shutting by hand during each chase scene",
        "One Battle After Another is the best movie of 2025 so far! \n\n- The movie does so much with its runtime. The first act itself could have been its own movie but Paul Thomas Anderson weaves it for a larger storytelling\n- Teyana Taylor is central focus in the first act and she delivers\n- Leonardo DiCaprio is firing on all cyclinders here. The meltdown he has on the phone are hilarious. I think he is a lock to win a Golden Globe \n- The entire 2nd act is amazing! I think the score was present for the entire the 2nd act, rasining the tension and stakes\n- Chase Infinti holds her own against Sean Penn and Leo\n- The climax of the movie is incredible. Using the rollercoaster valley roads as the ending set-piece is very unique and memorable.\n\n\nI can compliment this movie all the day but the greatest compliment I can give is this is going to one of the movies that comes on TV in the future and you will just watch it, regardless of which part the movie is at.",
        "This had some of my favourite character names in a while, I have to say - Colonel Lockjaw, Sensei Sergio, Virgil Throckmorton, and who can forget Jungle Pussy!\n\nSean Penn was the standout for me, his fuckin' walk nearly killed me, especially after \"I'm not gay, if that's what you think - I am not a homosexual!\"",
        "Anyone else expect the scene with Sensei prepping while Bob is on the phone was going to end differently? I thought for sure they were going to reveal he knew the passcodes, he even mutters \"8:15\" when Bob is screaming about what time it is and I didn't realize he was giving the actual time.",
        "I actually loved that this was kind of a misdirect. No one single person in the movie was a deus ex machina hero. They each played their parts to get Bob to where he needed to be.",
        "So after the prologue, the whole plot of the movie goes into motion because a racist guy wants to kill his daughter to get into a club",
        "Basically. To put it even simpler, everything’s put into motion because a loser wants to feel important. ",
        "Curious about the Latino perspective on the film. For me, some of it was real hard to watch, it felt so real. When families were being moved and being told not to be scared and they spoke in Spanish, I cried. Yes, this is our reality and I’m used to it and we’ve been fighting forever but seeing it on the big screen felt different. I really hope it didn’t contribute to normalization but instead opens some eyes.\n\nThere were points where Bob was being walked around and introduced and I felt like, of course this is what our community does…we help others in times of need. Others in the theater laughed, I don’t think they got it the same way. I get that it’s political satire but some of the scenes felt so intensely real and timely, it made it hard. Then comes Benicio del Toro, he gave me so much comfort in watching those scenes. I really enjoyed the movie pero oof!\n\n*The detention center images were sanitized compared to the real thing rn. It’s gotten much worse since the film was shot. F the migra and Alligator Alcatraz.\n\n**Shout out to the hero Latina nurses in the movie who saved the day!",
        "Semon Demon was probably the most funniest line I've heard all year. Something about the way he said it, tickled my funny bone ha\n\nBut anyways \n\nTop 3 films of the year for me and the 2nd best PTA film. \n\nThere were no low points, only highs and high highs.",
        "For some reason the funniest line to me was the way Sensei casually tells the cops he had a “few small beers\" with a grin on his face.",
        "The car chase through the desert valley might be the best car chase in cinema. At least, it’s my favorite by far. It’s so tense, but also hypnotic in a way. Perfectly drives home the state of paranoia that’s such a key part of the film.",
        "Kinda funny seeing an old white supremacist trying to \"abort\" his 16 year old child just because she's mixed race and would have him be seen as impure in the eyes of the 'adventurers'"
