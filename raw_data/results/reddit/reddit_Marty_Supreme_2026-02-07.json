    "Paul Thomas Anderson pushes back on the idea that the industry no longer greenlights daring/original projects, naming his favorites from 2025 as examples: 'Weapons', 'Bugonia', 'Sentimental Value', 'Eddington', 'Blue Moon', 'Nouvelle Vague' and 'Marty Supreme'.": [
      "Every couple months a movie comes out where everyone’s like, *”they don’t make movies like this anymore,”* and I know the industry is facing some genuine existential threats, but at this point I kinda think they actually *do* make movies like this anymore.",
      "I think people tend to echo that complaint because they keep forgetting that filmmaking constantly evolves, so they’re not seeing the kind of movies they used to.",
      "I also think we have to remember that that most people aren’t freaks like us who spend their time in r/movies actively looking for this stuff. Most people only see what’s being very broadly advertised, which is usually the remakes and franchises from big brands",
      "And only what’s on Netflix or whatever service they have. I think a lot of folks are completely put off by the idea of renting a movie, let alone going to the theater",
      "This one drives me nuts. I remember going to kickbacks with friends and we'd be talking and one of us would bring up some cool ass movie we all enjoyed from the 90s or something and we'd be like \"Oh man, we should totally watch that, that's such a good movie!\" and then we check Netflix and it's not there and the friend group would be like \"Oh well let's just pick something different.\" BRO. I will pay the 3.99 or whatever, I said I wanted to watch Airheads with Brenden Fraser, you all fucking agreed you wanted to watch it, too. We are not 'settling' with some god damn Netflix original slop movie. We're watching Airheads god dammit",
      "this more than anything.  they're going to have to look for the better films because usually they dont have massive marketing budgets.  look for good directors and good actors and the good films will follow",
      "I think this is the real issue.  It's not that they don't make original stuff, it's that they don't *promote* original stuff.  You have go looking for it and it can be a bit of a trial sometimes to find what you're looking for.",
      "They do promote it, but they cannot promote ir as much as marketing budgets are expensive.  In this era where people try to avoids ads as much as possible, they probably blocked any online campaign they attempted.",
      "And also they mostly remember the good ones from the past and filter out all the garbage along the way. It's why everyone thinks SNL was only good when they were younger. They only remember the iconic sketches and forget that at least half the sketches were duds/forgettable",
      "There are incredible and fresh films coming out regularly. The unfortunate truth is that audiences just aren't curious.",
      "That's really the core of all this, flashy stuff sells and studios have enough money to add all the flashy stuff to draw in audiences. Meanwhile indie films live and die purely off the quality of their content, so those are always going to be the stories pushing the envelope and evolving the craft further by nature of their precarious position in the attention market.\n\nNo matter what the medium, indie content will always be more interesting than what the big names release, it needs to be in order to be worthwhile",
      "Agreed. As the saturation of entertainment options has increased in the last two decades, movies that might have taken hold with general audiences back in the early 2000’s don’t anymore. I’ll frequently hear people say “There’s nothing good playing in theaters anymore” which just isn’t true. Everyone is overwhelmed with ways to fill their free time and are increasingly pushed into bubbles by algorithms that filter out anything that might challenge or widen their current taste.",
      "Audiences also arent being advertised to about these movies.",
      "Ido think there's a lack of light hearted non boundary pushing movies. like rom coms, comedies, and adventures movies that would play in that pg13 family movie night. Those were only made for that rental money",
      "I think they are still curious…\n\nWhen it gets to be a streaming movie instead. \n\nBack when a 32 inch Trinitron was a “big screen” of course folks were going to the theater more.\n\nBut now the home experience is soooo much better, shit you can get a 75 inch widescreen TV for 500 bucks if you’re not super anal about the fine details of the picture.  Tack on a virtual surround soundbar with a sub. \n\nYou can pause. Use the restroom. Get a drink that’s already in your fridge. Then stream it in 4K.\n\nOf course the year or so that theaters closed for Covid just entrenched this “streaming” mindset in people. \n\nI wish the type of adult dramas and comedies I grew up with would still bring the people to the theater but it’s really not happening anymore.\n\nYou have tentpoles and horror movies that make profit. The rest just scrounge for what they can until they find a new life on streaming.",
      "For every time I see that Hollywood isn’t making original scripts, I see Zootopia 2 making half of 1 billion in a weekend",
      "I have to say, I was surprised that Zootopia 2 wasn’t some mess. It was decent. Not as good as the original but still good.",
      "It was legitimately funny, too, not just children's humor. Hadn't laughed that much at an animated movie in the theater since maybe TMNT: Mutant Mayhem.",
      "The Shining scene was fantastic",
      "I loved it. It’s the first time in a while that the lame twist villain actually made perfect sense. And there was a Shining reference",
      "Disney has been doing a fine job on sequels. They used to pump out direct to video garbage, but these days the sequels are watchable at the very least, and sometimes really good.",
      "I think that there are a plethora of creative, original ideas that came out just this year alone. Looking back at the last 5 years just furthers this point, especially when you look at the awesome projects people were coming up with during COVID. People look at Disney remaking shit over and over and think that's endemic of the entire industry.\n\nCurmudgeon people have tunnel vision when it comes to what they react to that allows them to justify being curmudgeon. I go to the movies to feel and to have a good time. I don't go to bitch and whine.",
      "&gt;People look at Disney remaking shit over and over and think that's endemic of the entire industry.\n\nIt is frustrating how much control Disney has over what theaters actually show, though. You basically get 1-2 weeks to watch most movies before they are completely gone from theaters or only playing like once a day in the afternoon because Disney demands 4-8 weeks in several theaters from every theater that wants access to any Disney movies.\n\nI constantly miss movies I wanted to see in the theater because I was busy one week and couldn't find a reasonable showtime the next.",
      "Sure, but that is also because the other movies simply make less money than Disney.",
      "I don't have an issue with theaters showing the movies the most people are buying tickets to. But the problem is that Disney requires an absurd commitment both in time and number of theaters to be able to show any Disney films.\n\nThis leads to situations where I go to a movie in its first week that has three showings that day where the only evening showing is like half full while some Disney movie in the fourth week of its run has 4-6 showings that evening with like 5 people in each one.\n\nYou can prioritize the films that are making the most money without showing them many times to mostly empty theaters that could be showing other films instead. Theaters used to do this all the time. Then Disney grew and grew to the point that they can make these demands and theaters have no choice but to agree.",
      "&gt;I go to the movies to feel and to have a good time. I don't go to bitch and whine.\n\nI mentioned this a week or so back but I like to use the phrase \"perpetually blackpilled dorks\" when it comes to the internet and this sub in particular on this topic - how a lot of the discussion under posts for a particular movie now is nothing but people whining and whining, over and over with the same 5 complaints repeated under every new poster/trailer/etc. Its endless cynicism and barely any discussion about the actual movie itself.   \n  \nAnd then my personal favorite - the pretense that a year in question was \"weak\" for movies, when the only movies they've seen are remakes, reboots and superhero sequels.",
      "I can't tell if Reddit is getting worse or my \"outlook\" on life is getting more positive, making Reddit more and more insufferable in comparison, but lately I have really hated logging on to Reddit.",
      "The better your life is, the more you'll hate reddit. So many people on this website are just completely miserable.",
      "Well said, it's an issue in pretty much any subreddit that garners a large following. The default to most is to just be a cynical buzzkill about everything. Optimism is usually frowned upon.",
      "My hot take is that the last 5 years has given us some truly visionary, original, experimental work the likes of the 70s era of filmmaking had. It's just either not seen as much, too weird for audiences, or just hidden in a pile of too much other shit.",
      "since 2022 for sure.  2020 was particularity a rough year for ever facet of society",
      "Yeah every major studio has doubled down on their prestige and oddball outlets like Disney's Searchlight.",
      "\"They don't make movies like this anymore.\"\n\n\"They just did! The one you're talking about!\"",
      "It's like when my grandma used to tell me that I never called her... While I was on the phone with her. Because I called her.",
      "Honestly it's kind of the same in video games. People see the space being filled with Fortnite, Roblox, and Call of Duty and free-to-play games and think \"Oh woe is the game industry\" but like... there are also a billion fantastic and original indie games coming out on Steam every year. Never before has a gamer had a wider variety of styles of games to try out. It's hard for me to square the doomsaying with the plethora of great options.",
      "This is maybe part of a larger rant building off what you are saying, and it mostly just lines up with the \"everyone is 12 now\" theory going around, but I think people are constantly chasing the tail of how they experienced things when they were younger, rather than taking a broad look at everything.",
      "&gt;  A recent study shows the U.S. now produces around 2,500 features a year. That number was barely 800 in the 1990s. Global output sits somewhere between 8,000 and 9,000 titles a year\n\nAnime also has a similar problem.  10-15 years ago, there was a lot less shows to wade through.  Now there are like 30-50 shows a season.  Its making it difficult to find the good stuff because you have to wade through all the trash.",
      "I'm not sure that'd be a direct comparison, since I imagine we're talking a lot of extremely low budget films now that everyone above the global poverty line owns a okay quality video camera with editing capabilities. Whereas anime at least requires the budget to hire animators. I cannot imagine there are many $1000 animes, but there are surely quite a lot of $1000 movies now that you don't need to buy a Super-8 or a camcorder.",
      "Anime Before - Dragon Ball, Bleach, One Piece, Naruto, Yu Yu Hakusho... \n\nAnime Today - That Time I got Reincarnated as a Silver Soup Spoon in a Dark All Girls Marble Cave as I tried to Earn a Boyfriend.",
      "PTA: “The whole industry is constantly complaining. The sky is always falling. But let’s take a look at this year: “Eddington,” “Weapons,” “Bugonia,” two Richard Linklater films (”Nouvelle Vague” and “Blue Moon”), “Sentimental Value,” “Marty Supreme,” which is coming out. Whoever wants to start complaining about movies right now needs to cool it.”\n\n“Do I think things get put on streaming too fast? Yeah, I do. I think that’s a drag. I think a lot of things that happen in Hollywood are self-inflicted wounds.”",
      "Two linklater movies came out this year? Damn I never heard of either of them",
      "If Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater are doing a project together you know its probably going to be a good time",
      "can't believe i didn't hear about *Nouvelle Vague* until just now...and it's a biopic following the filming of one of my favorite movies ever, *Breathless.* going to watch it tonight!",
      "it was incredible, highly recommend it.",
      "Blue Moon is very good, a tad stagey but Ethan Hawke is great in it",
      "Blue Moon was absolutely tremendous",
      "Blue moon is one of my favorites for the year. Ethan Hawke and a sharp script are perfect together.",
      "Mid-level indies haven't gone anywhere -- streaming helps there. Studios footing budgets for things like One Battle After Another is another thing entirely. Let's hope it makes it's money back and a little more.",
      "He saw Tarantino making all these crappy opinions, and decided to seize the opportunity to start having some good ones",
      "I like Tarantinos crappy opinions. It gives us something to shit talk about.",
      "Yeah it’s fun and he probably gets a kick out of it too. I’m cracking up about him hating Paul dano in TWBB, and I haven’t even seen that film",
      "Tarantino at home in his giant mansion \"people online are upset about an off-hand comment I made about Paul Dano. It's fuckin hilarious\"",
      "I honestly hope that Paul Dano made some kind of unintentional slight at some point and Tarantino just couldn't let it go and has been carrying this grudge forever and that's why he's lashing out.  Like maybe they were at an industry banquet and Tarantino interrupted his conversation with Marty to be like, \"Yo, Marty Imma grab another one of those jalepeno poppers.  You want one?  I tell you, I can't get enough.  They're like spicy crack.\"  And Mary's like, \"That was my porn star name.\"  And Tarantino laughs and turns to the buffet table to see the platter with only two jalapeno poppers left.  *Perfect*, he thinks to himself as he moves in for the kill, but then out of the corner of his eye he sees a tall childlike man inching toward the table.  Panic sets in and he quickens his pace, but Dano's fuckin' lanky arm reaches across the width of the table and snipes *both* J-pops.  Tarantino just stands silent in defeat, uncertain where to go now.  He looks over at some stupid stuffed croissant things and then over to untouched celery sticks forming a ring around a bowl of ranch.  Nothing.  He heads back to Marty with exactly that, who immediately responds to Tarantino's sullen approach with, \"Hey, where's my popper?\"",
      "i'm going to laugh my ass off when paul dano is in tarantino's next movie",
      "I'm still reeling from that Dano hit piece. What a shit opinion from someone who otherwise clearly understands so much about cinema.",
      "Dano's gotta be like, \"What the fuck did I do?\"",
      "Giving a fuck when it's not your turn to give a fuck, McNulty.",
      "These are for you, McNulty",
      "Everytime QT drops a new opinion in a headline it's usually kinda shit",
      "I don't even think his movie list was that outrageous, and I mentioned yesterday how people were treating it as some sort of objectivity test - when there is none.\n\nBut those Dano quotes were...something. That goes beyond an opinion, that's stupendously weird hate with 0 basis lol",
      "I'm sorry but Black Hawk Down as the best movie of the 21st century is one of the worst takes I've ever heard in my entire life",
      "Luke warm, not so surprising take: Quentin Tarantino fuckin sucks. Not his movies, the man himself. Tho personally how much he sucks has had a direct effect on my ability to enjoy his films.",
      "He sucks just for all the positive things he has said about Harvey Weinstein over the years when he absolutely had to know what a monster he is.",
      "and his defense on romanski and pedophilia is horrible.",
      "SAME! I cannot STAND the guy which makes me really sour on his movies. I'm sorry, but a guy who inserts himself into his movies so he can say the n-word and drink booze off of a woman's feet, is constantly obsessing over the feet of what are essentially his employees, and is otherwise creepy as fuck... I just cannot enjoy media from that guy.",
      "&gt;For those who find this to be wild commentary coming from a man who may not have gotten much screen time were he not able to cast himself in his own projects, Tarantino doubled down. \n\n\nAt least this bit on the CNN article made me giggle lmao ",
      "QT thrives on being a contrarian for the sake of being a contrarian at times.",
      "Its so weird, it's like he wants to be a contrarian because most people (I'd say rightfully) consider Dano to be a great actor.",
      "When you view everything QT says through the lens of him being a purposefully edgy contrarian - it makes perfect sense.",
      "There's a lot of validity to that. There are scores of great original films released every single year but a lot of people don't bother to dig to find them. It's a shame.",
      "I also see a lot of people saying they don't bother to go see non-blockbusters in theatres. So Im sure that doesn't help",
      "Yeah I hate that Reddit is on the anti-theater circlejerk, and they always come up with all of these possible scenarios why it might be annoying. Like it can be expensive, but saying my living room is just as compelling as a movie theater isn’t really true.",
      "People just have different opinions and preferences. The type of person to be active on reddit is more likely to stay in anyway. I haven't been to a theater in a long time, I just can't seem to find the motivation. I also deal with manic depression though.",
      "I love theatres, even for smaller movies it's so superior to my living room. I have a good sound setup, and a nice TV as well. Granted I'm in Canada and we really only have one chain where I'm at but it's like 15 CAD, less on a Tuesday, to see a movie. Nice seats, clean floors, and most people are fine.\n\nBut all that said I use very little streaming, and buy Blurays and such",
      "It's crazy how passionate this sub is about refusing to ever see movies in theaters. I go to the movies a few times a year. I have for many many years. I go to AMC on Tuesdays when tickets are cheaper. I share a large popcorn with a friend and usually get a drink. It costs me about $12 total. Every once in a great while someone might be talking or on their phone in the theater but it's super rare.\n\n\nThen I see the weekly \"I haven't been to the movies in 5 years and I'm never going ever again,\" circlejerk thread here and people are like \"it costs $50 a person to go to theaters now, you have to wait in line for an hour for snacks and then there's babies screaming and teenagers on their phones scrolling tik tok the whole time!\" Come on now, just admit you hate leaving your apartment. Going to the movies by in large is the best way to see movies and there are ways to not pay the for the most experience tickets possible.",
      "I'm thinking this whole issue really lies in the conflict between traditional moviegoing at theatres and streaming, especially with what gets pushed more to the forefront in marketing &amp; how it relates to the browsing habits of  today's consumers of films, plus other directors still trying to push back against streaming (which does conflict with what others are saying about theaters being more expensive today)",
      "I think this is the greater issue for movies. The media culture is so fractured now that you really have to be on top of things to know what's coming out in theaters. I'd say that franchise movies get more hype simply because of their built-in audiences having dedicated fan spaces, while unique films have a harder time marketing in the current landscape because they don't necessarily have a big niche to play off of.",
      "This brings to mind the idea the thought that even if I don't think there's a shortage of good original films in a given year like this year, I'm also aware that there's the possibility that movies don't just compete against each other, but there's also TV, &amp; even content creators and live streamers from YouTube, Twitch,etc. are becoming a more prominent source for entertainment/media consumption from audiences",
      "Bugonia might be my favorite movie of the year",
      "Bugonia was a remake of Save the Green Planet!",
      "Yeah bug that's not what people are decrying when they talk about too many remakes",
      "Yeah I would find it hard to believe that Bugonia was greenlit because of the strength of Save the Green Planet IP",
      "The director of Save the Green Planet was developing the remake himself but had to withdraw to health reasons, the project was presented to Lanthimos who came on board and reworked it.",
      "Look its fine to disagree but let's not call each other bug",
      "It was a typo but too good to change ",
      "Listen up bug, and that’s short for Bugonia",
      "Yeah, hundreds of original movies get released every year, not everything is a blockbuster adaptation/remake/sequel. The issuse of course is that not as many people are going to see these original movies, but if you claim they don't exist, then clearly you aren't going to see them either.",
      "Byproduct of a culture of convenience. \n\nMost people don’t really make the effort to go searching for that original material, they just check out what gets pushed to their recommended tab on streaming platforms (this applies to tv as well as music).\n\nThere isn’t any sense of urgency to break out of this holding pattern, which is what leads people to say things like, “I’m experiencing X fatigue.” And this is despite the fact that they have virtually unlimited choices presented to them at all times.",
      "I think most people who mourn original cinema want original blockbusters! Low budget indie films are original yes, but do they also appeal to general audiences? Also there were some original more expensive films. But seriously you don‘t save the cinema experience with depressing Ari Aster films.\n\nSome filmmakers are probably capable of reaching wider audiences (Zach Cregger for example). Give them more money to make movies that won‘t let you miss Spielberg, Cameron or Nolan.",
      "I think the real metric is $$$ how much money have studios put into these movies versus 'blockbuster slop'. I'm willing to bet the budget total is less than 10% and thats the problem...",
      "Ok I got receipts. The TOTAL budget of all these movies combined is 249.8 million. The budget for JUST Mission Impossible is 400 million alone. Thats the issue...",
      "Both sides can be true. Studios can greenlight as many daring exciting ideas as they like but that doesn't mean that a) the general public will go see them enough to justify a paradigm shift in film budgets and b) studios will stop making as-close-to-guaranteed moneymakers as possible. \n\nThe difference between now and the last time it felt like a new idea could be a genuine smash hit was, what, maybe the 90s? Back then, the newest original idea film would be the buzz of the season or at least the week or two. Have you had a casual conversation with anyone, outside of Reddit, about the symbolic undertones of Eddington? Do people even talk about the big twist ending to that film? Weapons came closest, I think, to being a big bold public push but they're already trying to capitalize on the one major character with spinoff potential and giving her a prequel. \n\nThere are outliers of course. For a while, Jordan Peele's original ideas seemed like big deals, for instance. Genre-filmmaking will always have a few big hits, like horror with Terrifier or comedy with Nobody or Novocaine.\n\nThe issue is streaming has diluted the pool of entertainment. There's too many options and you only ever hear about the truly great and the truly terrible anymore, and most of the time it's series, not movies, because we need more and more content and a tight 2 hour runtime isn't going to cut it, that's barely enough time to get cozy, order DoorDash, scroll Reddit, message our friends...",
      "Yeah, these original movies do exist BUT ALSO  for a myriad of reasons, people don’t see them: ticket prices making people want to only see a movie they ‘know’ they’ll love; marketing being practically non existent for originals, while franchise blockbusters are inescapable; the big budget stuff hogs the actual theaters, so finding a showing of the original stuff is more effort etc",
      "he forgot to mention Sinners which was an original IP and a huge risk for WB given the budget",
      "I feel like all the directors of these movies have made profitable enough movies in the past that a studio investing in them to make another film isn't so much of a risk because they know there's an audience for it.",
      "Another day, another “two things can be true at once” reminder",
      "In this case, the thing that is true is that original movies usually don't make as much money, but they are still getting made.",
      "Does Bugonia count as original tho? It's a remake of a Korean movie.",
      "Original? No. Daring to put out in wide release? Fairly."

    "‘Marty Supreme’ Becomes A24’s Highest-Grossing Film Domestically With $80 Million": [
      "Previous record was *Everything Everywhere All at Once* with $77 million domestically.",
      "I know there's accusations of it being overhyped, but I absolutely adored EEAAO, and am surprised it didn't crest $100m at the box office.",
      "It made $140m worldwide, the $77m were just from the US",
      "D'oh. My *brain* inserted \"domestic\" before \"box office\" in my comment, but my fingers didn't follow suit.",
      "You and your hotdog fingers",
      "It did $140m globally. Plus it was also much cheaper than Marty Supreme. EEAAO cost around $25m, while Marty Supreme cost $60m.",
      "I would bet the EEAAO had less than 50% of the marketing budget that Marty Supreme had.",
      "Possibly, but to me it seemed like it was just  Chalamet hitting up niche podcasts, doing viral reels, that kind of thing. Stuff that was aimed at a young crowd. Really working outside the traditional areas.",
      "According to Google, Marty Supreme had a marketing budget near 70 million compared to just 20-25 million for EEAAO. There was a definite push for Marty Supreme.",
      "There are fully salaried creative teams who make the plan to do said things. Budget was used on creative strategy rather than basic marketing with high production",
      "EEAAO was a huge commercial success, though. It truly was not expected to make as much as it did. Its budget was also tiny.",
      "It was the Multiverse of Madness we wanted…",
      "Truly one of the most moving films I’ve seen in a very very along time. A real labor of love that movie was and executed perfectly, really cannot be overrated imho",
      "The fucking rocks got me so bad. Then it having the googly eyes and moving.    \n\nBut \"In another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you.\" really just broke me.",
      "I'm gonna get you",
      "That line really sealed the movie for me… because it means our Waymond was walking the walk, he was genuinely happy just doing laundry and taxes, as long as it was with Evelyn.",
      "I went in thinking it was just going to be a multiverse movie. I was expecting something like a better version \"The One\" with Jet Li. \n\nBut, it not only had great action but was one of the funniest movies I have seen. And it has a really touching message. It kind of felt illegal for a movie to have so much within it.",
      "There’s a shot where they rapid cycle like 100 different versions of Jobu and I was like, holy shit that was a LOT of work for less than a second of screen time. They poured a lot of work and love into that film.",
      "Absolutely. Cried my eyes out.",
      "My sell on it is never in my life did I think *two fucking rocks* would make be bawl",
      "I felt like my soul had been touched by that film.  Sublime is how I would describe it.",
      "It really was an incredibly special movie, like I was thankful to have watched it. It’s rare to see a movie that has so much heart that it just overwhelms you with its sincerity.",
      "I went into that film with high expectations and it surpassed my high expectations. It's really unique, poignant, funny at times, and overall very entertaining. IMO it deserved every speck of praise it got. \n\nThere are plenty of movies that get unwarranted praise (Crash, Shakespeare in Love, Green Book, American Beauty) but EEAAO isn't one of them.",
      "That came out towards the tail end of COVID.",
      "That movie fucking ruled. I still think it's hilarious that A24 released it a few weeks before the MCU film literally titled *Multiverse of Madness* and managed to do a better job with the concept.\n\n\nThe weird reddit hipster thing of hating EEAAO will never kill my enjoyment of it.",
      "I mean, I liked it but it's 100% understandable that it might not be everyone's cup of tea.",
      "This entire thread is people saying how great EEAO is. Almost like there is more than one person here.\n\nPersonally, I don’t find a multiverse or super hero film interesting.",
      "Good for A24. I hope this kind of money boost (as I understand it) can continue to fund more projects. They’ve strayed from the fully indie route but not entirely and I appreciate the unique stories so much, even the ones I don’t love - I just want to see cool stuff!",
      "they're too big internally to stay in the \"indie\" studio category but they're in the \"darkhorse\" echelon for \"off the wall\" scripts and directors",
      "As long as they can keep making great political period pieces like Judas and the Black Messiah, I will be happy. Great movie\n\nEdit: how embarrassing, not A24 lol, I could have sworn it was",
      "That was from Warner Bros.",
      "The fact you thought that was an A24 movie says everything about A24 &amp; their fans.\n\nI've had people cite Anora &amp; Longlegs as why they love A24 too.",
      "I'm so glad A24 exists. Sometimes you just want an interesting story, not a non stop thrill ride block buster. ",
      "Absolutely. I’ve been enjoying Neon (as a horror movie lover) too for this reason. \n\nAre they sometimes misses? Of course, but are they different and hard to figure out (love a movie I can’t guess everything about!) - yup!",
      "The A24/NEON-ification of modern horror and thrillere the past few years has been interesting to watch. Anyone who saw Warner Bros \"Weapons\" or other big studio horror like \"HIM\" can see the A24/Neon influence all over it. Sure  there will always be the Blumhouse/James Wan style of horror, and the D level straight to VOD cheapo horror, but even Shudder has been influenced by the cryptic slowburn or Euro arthouse Kodak film style if horror.\n\n\ni remember seeing Longlegs at a sold out show of mostly youth on preview night, realizing that normie audiences have finally warmed to movies with definitive Gialo horror/grindhouse and artsy elements. Most everything in the 2020s has sucked, but cinema and streaming prestige shows feel more alive than ever",
      "\"non stop thrill ride\" is basically the perfect description of Marty Supreme. It starts out at 11 and never lets off the gas. You don't get a chance to take a breath or regain balance as the character lurches from one crisis to another.",
      "You are not wrong. But I went in thinking it would be Uncut Gems level of stress, and it was actually so laidback in comparison that I felt all right at the end lol.",
      "Wha..? Marty Supreme totally follows the same Safdie Brothers template of Uncut Gems and Good Times: Nervous New York guy digs himself into a deeper paranoid hole backed by a hypnotic feverish Daniel Lopatin score. I was bummed to hear the Safdies split ways, but I guess Josh Safdie is continuing the vibe if the previous films.",

      "Yes. The director is one of the two brothers who directed uncut gems.",
      "One of my top movies, infact, the top movie on my list from last year, was Warfare. A24 produced one of the absolute best war/anti-war films ever IMO. It was like the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan, but turned into a whole film and modernized.",

      "Action movies are now either massive blockbusters, or low tier straight to streaming crap.",
      "This has always been true",
      "I know this might be shade, but this is actually why I went to see it. I wanted to see Timothy’s performance because I think he’s a good actor and this is an unusual role where he can show off his skills. My son talked me into going to see it with him. It’s basically uncut gems with ping-pong, not my personal kind of movie, but the acting was very good.",

Am excited for his future movies and am excited to watch Marty supreme this week as it comes out in Australia this week.",

      "When the Safdies parted directorial ways, I was bummed as I wanted to see another paranoid New Yorker nervously digs himself deeper in a hole backed by a feverish Daniel Lopatin score. I was like ugh....two sports movies? The Smashing Machine's Rock UFC movie and a ping pong movie? Turns out Josh Safdies Ping Pong movie IS the continuation of the Uncut Gems/Good Time vibe. And with a little A24 supernatural twist at the end.",

The movie was awesome and I’m totally rooting for Tim to continue this streak of great films he’s involved in because with this performance and previous ones and how he promotes it he clearly cares about his craft.",
      "I went with my son (17 years old) and we both loved it, but I don't know about it being \"fun.\" It was so stressful! Every scene was so tense. Chalamet gave an amazing performance. He was so despicable, and yet we were both rooting for the guy.",

      "lmao they reported it as a flop?? insane",
      "They didn’t flat out call it a flop, but they *heavily* implied it by questioning if it could have the legs to be profitable. People have been comparing it to Marty because Marty had a weaker opening than Sinners during Christmas, yet Variety reported on it in a much more positive light.",
      "the power of a relentless marketing campaign",

But there's so much attention to detail. There's so many small insignificant things that are given no highlights that come in later. I definitely think there's a strong argument for watching it twice because there's a lot of stuff with Bob at the start of the movie pre-kid that seems like dressing and knowing how he ends up and what he has to deal with makes it more interesting. And the performances are really good. Sean Penn is so goddamn weird but still grounded in a way that feels vaguely like I've met that kind of guy before. Leo being a struggling fuck up who's energy is at a 10 almost the whole movie is super entertaining. And in particular the whole segment where hes with Del Toro is amazing for what is happening as a whole. There is so much to take in between what Bob's doing, what Del Toro is doing, and what the background is doing. There's some really entertaining coregraphy for that whole portion of the movie.",

There were tons of walkouts at that one though. Imagine walking out before Rose fucking' Byrne comes on for a Q&amp;A. Couldn't be me.\n\nThe movies that had the most walkouts this year:\n\n* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You**\n* **[The Chronology of Water](https://i.imgur.com/iRt4Y0a.jpeg)** (i swear at least 150 people walked out of this one)\n* **[The Testament of Ann Lee](https://i.imgur.com/HzGkRUj.jpeg)** \n\nThe first two make sense. Those movies are *aggressive*. They actively don't give a shit about your feelings. They want to make you feel like shit. **Ann Lee** makes no sense, nobody should be walking out of that. If you walk out of **Ann Lee** we can't be friends.\n\nSome of my favorite Q&amp;As of the year:\n\n* **[Hamnet](https://i.imgur.com/lz0ckDo.jpeg)** (Chloe Zhao, Paul Mescal, Jessie Buckley, Noah Nupe, Jacobi Jupe, Emily Watson)\n* **[I Love LA](https://i.imgur.com/LG1KBNe.jpeg)** (Rachel Sennott, Odessa A'Zion, True Whitaker)\n* **[Left-Handed Girl](https://i.imgur.com/PGUjHY0.jpeg)** (Shih-Ching Tsou, Nina Ye, Shih-Yuan Ma)\n* **[Highest 2 Lowest](https://i.imgur.com/Xw82HNO.jpeg)** (Spike Lee)\n* **[Blood for Dracula](https://i.imgur.com/Y4tPY9i.jpeg)** (Udo Kier, RIP)\n\nThe two biggest standing ovations I was a part of this year:\n\n* **[Christy](https://imgur.com/a/Bpr1MO4)** (Played really well at TIFF, not so much everywhere else)\n* **[Frankenstein](https://i.imgur.com/7kEFgcG.jpeg)** (There was probably 100+ cast/crew there for this one, including all of the big stars and GDT. It's a hometown movie (Toronto, for TIFF), so this was a no-brainer.)",
      "Holy shit. I wanted to go to that Q&amp;A at Lincoln Square. Shocked to read there were walkouts. It’s an intense movie like Uncut Gems…. But Rose should be nominated for Best Actress. I wouldn’t walk out on that potential Q&amp;A unless I was having a legit panic attack. ",

It's more so sad and messed up that you end up laughing as a defense mechanism than a comedy. \n\nRoofman did a similar thing where the trailer made it look like a fun romcom with a wacky premise. The actual movie is super sad. \n\nIn my showings of both some people left like a third of the way through the movie. I'm guessing the people felt baited and switched by the trailers and asked to swap tickets for a different movie.",

      "Here are some reviews/thoughts I had to cut to fit the maximum character count:\n\n* **The Threesome** - 8/10 - Really really really great stuff. Smart, funny, heartfelt. It could be a really cheesy setup (threesome goes horribly wrong), but it takes lots of turns you don't expect and it's super smartly written and excellently acted (especially Zoey Deutsch). Sweet little comfort movie. Dope soundtrack too.\t\n\n* **Final Destination: Bloodlines** 8/10 - I've always had a soft-spot for the original, but the other movies didn't do much for me and I even skipped some. Was originally going to skip this one but really glad I didn't. A new high-point for the series. Kind of everything I want in a horror. Funny, surprisingly, nasty/hilarious kills. It subverts your expectations at every corner and has one of the best mic-drop endings of the year. Give me more\n\n* **Bring Her Back** - 8/10  Jesus christ. Really great horror film, and apart from one very weird/jarring/out-of-place tonal shift near the end (when there's the cleaning montage and the one-liner of the girl playing ball), it's consitent throughout.\t\n\n* **Christy** - 7/10 - It’s a boxing biopic with a tragic 2nd act and a happy ending. You’ve seen it a million times, but really solid lead performances from Sydney Sweeney (in her best role yet) and Ben Foster (at his most reviling) and a sweeping, war-movie-like orchestral score keep it engaging throughout. Chad Coleman only has a few minutes of screentime but he makes them memorable as Don King, highlight of the movie for me. In a just world, he’d get Supporting Actor Oscar buzz. \t\n\n* **The Surfer** - 7/10 - Pretty challenging watch and will test a lot of people's patience but it ultimately pays off, even though you're left with a lot of questions (in a good way). Another classic weird-Cage performance that builds up perfectly. Loved all of the extremely-uncomfortable close-ups. You doubt yourself for a lot of the movie which I really enjoyed.\t\n* **Blue Heron** - 7/10 - Canada's *We Need To Talk About Kevin*. Unfortunately, the subtitles weren't on during my screening so I probably missed some important stuff, but it's an impressive debut film with a complicated-but-well-done timeline.\t\n\n* **A Big Beautiful Journey** - 7/10 - Everyone hates it, I liked it. Yes it drags a bit in the middle and some of the 'visiting the past' scenes are weird (50-year old Colin Farrell confessing love to his 15-year old high school crush...?), and I would pay money for the 3-minute Burger King ad in the middle to not exist, but the soundtrack/needle drops were built in a lab specifically for me and there's a lot of sweet moments. It's corny in the best way, filled with goofy lines like \"I prefer to feel nervous with you than nothing alone\", which just kinda worked for me.\t\n\n* **The Wizard of the Kremlin** - 7/10 - There's a 9/10 movie in here somewhere with some better editing/pacing. Literally all of the first ~30 minutes can be cut. Jeffrey Wright can be cut, Alicia Vikander can be cut. Concentrate more on Putin and you've got a stew going. Right now, it's a bunch of solid potential and great performances that result in not much of anything. Paul Dano trying to play a teenager for a few scenes was very not good. Good movie, could be a lot better.\n\n* **On Swift Horses** - 7/10 - A bit long and melodramatic but kept you engaged enough (with two intertwined storylines) to keep it interesting. Daisy Edgar Jones is great (+ some steamy lesbian sex scenes for all u sick pervs). Kinda over Jacob Elordi's schtick though. He's played the same character for like 5 movies in a row. He's always just doing a James Dean impression.\t\n\n* **Rust** - 7/10 - Went in with rock-bottom expectations but it was surprisingly solid. Very well writen and well shot, with solid performances (especially Travis Fimmel, one of the best supporting performances of the year so far). It's definitely a bit slow and long (most people will get bored), but the dialogue really works and there's a lot of depth to the worldbuilding. Hard to ignore the tragedy during the movie though, the movie starts off with someone accidentally shooting someone and you're just like \"oof\".\t\n\n* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You** - 6/10 - Rose Byrne puts in an incredible performance and is supported by a great cast, especially Conan O’Brien and ASAP Rocky) who’s starting to pop up and standout in lots of things recently), but the constant close-ups and confusing drug &amp; alcohol-induced blow-ups keep it from going great. They got a bit repetitive. The smashed-hamster to lasagna sequence was top-tier as far as transitions go though. \t\n\n* **Hard Truths** - 5/10 - Introduces you to possibly the most irritating character ever put on the big screen (and not in a good way like *Naked*), with zero redeeming qualities and no arc, with a frustratingly pointless ending. Very very rough. I know that Mike Leigh won't hold your hand and answer all of the questions, but sheesh, I needed something more. Huge disappointment.\n\n* **Fuze** - 5/10 -  I haven’t seen a third act derailment this bad since *White Noise*. Just a total mess in the last 30 minutes that completely kills a somewhat-decent premise. I don't know if David Mackenzie has another *Hell or High Water* in him.\n\n* **Eastern Western** - 3/10 - If you thought Kevin Costner's *Horizon* was slow, wait until you get a hold of this. The hardest I had to fight to slay asleep all year. Would make for a good white noise machine to fall asleep.\t\n\n* **High Rollers** - 3/10 - You'll see a lot of people joke about movies being money laundering schemes, but this could *actually* be one. The director, Randall Emmett, is probably the shadiest dude in Hollywood. He keeps bankrolling John Travolta's straight-to-the-garbage-bin movies somehow. A documentary about how his films are made would undoubetdly be more interesting than this trash.\n\n* **Good American Family** - 3/10 - Garbage streaming true-crime slop. Very messy. It wants to be serious and dark but it's so cartoony and poorly executed. It's filmed like a car commercial. But Mark Duplass is the champion of indie film so I'll always support. He basically admitted (several times) during the Q&amp;A that he basically took this gig to fund his more serious, indie films.",

I spent a year avoiding trailers/discussion threads/recaps/Wiki plot synopses and my movie-going experience improved dramatically. We've lost surprise nowadays. There are so many moments that would've landed like a nuclear strike if I hadn't already seen them in trailers over the years, I highly recommend this strategy to people. It can be difficult to avoid spoilers, but it's not impossible.",
      "I'm the same way, I avoid trailers whenever I can. Depending on the chain, I'll show up 10-20 minutes past showtime so I can skip as many trailers as possible. Other than a synopsis and knowing who's involved, I go in as blind as possible to every movie.",

It's like a 6/10 movie at best, with one or *maybe* two incredible sequences saving basically the entire thing from being a total disaster.\n\n(OP also gives Jurassic World Rebirth a 7/10, and it's probably the worst film I saw this year, so I'm guessing this list is not going to be particularly helpful for me...)",
      "Agreed, the whole Entity storyline is colossally stupid, Gabriel is the biggest nothingburger villain I've seen in a long time, and the guy got two whole movies! The writing is clunky as all hell. The submarine and plane sequences are good but far too much of the movie is just plain bad.",

Marty talks his way into Kay’s life (and bed) through sheer bravado, even trying to coordinate business deals with Kay’s husband, Milton (Kevin O’Leary of “Shark Tank” fame), while he sleeps with his wife.\n\n\nObviously, I haven't seen the movie. But I will just never understand this obsession so many writers have with the idea that every married woman is just waiting to cheat, every man wants to be the one she does it with, and this is all light-hearted, cool and even aspirational.\n\nHas this notion that women are all selfish, dishonest and primarily motivated by having sex with \"better\" men (or that men need to be constantly competing with other men for that role, and getting it is the ultimate triumph) done anything good for our society, between Elliot Rodger and Andrew Tate? Why promote it further?\n\nI find it bizarre that people continue to write and take roles in these puerile and pessimistic narratives, while presenting them as funny or romantic, as if love can never be more than social Darwinism. What's even the appeal to the audience? I guarantee there are more Emory Cohens than Timothee Chalamets out there.\n\nOf course, perhaps this goes in a vastly different direction than I'm expecting. But from what I've read, I doubt it.",
      "You should actually watch the movie before projecting onto the film whatever cliche social shenanigans you're assuming will be playing out.  \n\nThe whole point was exactly that Marty's hustler persona was not getting him anywhere like he originally thought it was.  Gwyneth's character, as well, didn't end up anywhere satisfying.  And also her husband was not portrayed with any glory.  \n\nBasically everyone who was in their ego, social climbing, or living for themselves alone, rather than living from an authentic heart-centered place of loyalty, is shown as doing life wrong.  \n\nThe Japanese ping pong master is symbolic of something very beautiful, something that requires no outside validation.  It all makes sense in the film, if you'd actually watch it before commenting.\n\nCriticizing a movie you haven't seen yet is wild work.  Go see it.",

I just thought it was an actor who did a really perfect job in the role.  He reminds me a bit of the great actor and director Sydney Pollack, who has acted in Woody Allen films.  To bail on seeing one of the most talked about and exciting films of the year because some guy from Shark Tank is acting in the film seems really unnecessarily snobbish.

It harnesses the same anxious, unrelenting tension of Good Time and Uncut Gems, but it redirects and reshapes that energy into something more approachable, aspiration, and—I mean this in the absolute best sense—broad.\n\nAs unhinged as this wild ride of a film is, you can still take your whole (adult) family to this one.",

Basically, Josh allowed a former convicted felon to flash his genitals at a minor and try to have sex with her and Josh basically did nothing to stop it. It apparently caused the young girl to spiral on set (and it's likely her being a minor was against the rules for her to be in the scene anyways). This apparently is what caused the Sadie's to end their working relationship as Benny blamed Josh for what happened.\n\nAlso, apparently he hired another felon on Marty Supreme who threatened Timothee with violence as well. Basically, Josh is not a great guy. Josh breaks a lot of rules and it's unclear how much Benny was involved in them, though the sources seem to suggest Josh was the one running the show.",

Chalamet doesn’t do a great job — basically plays himself but high strung. Doesn’t sound like a Jewish person from Manhattan during the time period while others do. Characters are eternally annoying and scheming while the emotional plug at the end feels cheap. Their motivations and actions are questionable on multiple occasions. I’ve like a lot of movies this year but not this one — it was a B-. I think everyone lauds Safdie for Uncut Gems (I like Good Time) and so they want to get on board with his success and not be late to the party. ",
      "I disagree so hard. And I need a refresh, but I remember hating Uncut Gems.\n\nI found the characters so much more interesting and complex than that. Most of them are bad in their own way, but have redeeming qualities and their motivations and actions seemed clearly in line with the way they were painted.\n\nAnd I don’t think the ending was a cheap emotional plug at all. I wasn’t deeply moved, but it didn’t feel like the intention to me. It was a great way to wrap up his story arc from ditching everything, doing wrong by so many people just to achieve his goal, just to go back to the core of love, care, and responsibility.\n\nI see so many critiques about Marty not “getting what he deserved”, and I wonder why every movie needs to have direct actions and consequences, when life just isn’t that simple. It felt like a character study in that way, and people are left to draw their own conclusions.\n\nI’m likely not adding much to the discussion, but I really loved this one so wanted to reply. Movie of the year in my opinion.",
      "Well hey, I’m glad you liked it. I wanted to, but sometimes it just doesn’t hit. Didn’t see many redeeming qualities when everything was a ploy and manipulation to advance self interest — Marty ping pong sleeping with another man’s wife and his love interest being fake beat up and adulterer. They’re really pretty awful people full stop. Why do I have to root for them?\n\nI’ll get downvoted some more but I don’t mind expressing my opinion. For the record — I think downvotes should be a tool for someone that writes a poor comment not something you don’t agree with, but it’s Reddit. Marty Supreme was a great movie for casual movie fans, felt like a blockbuster pretending to be an indie film. \n\nI think Chalamet is a great actor, I remember saying that as the film ended. But his characterization of a 50s Jewish person from Manhattan just did not sound like it. Am I wrong about this? Didn’t he sound like a sped up Chalamet the whole time? For me that’s more like Gene Hackman or Brad Pitt who mostly play themselves instead of someone like Gary Oldman who just melts into the character.\n\nI think your critique of “not getting what he deserved” is strange. It’s not that kind of movie. But I still think how in the last 5 mins he does a 180 and is now a caring father. Hey, I’m glad and it isn’t a bad way to end it. Just felt like there could have been more movement to his core character instead of hey I won my ping pong match now I can be a good dad/person.\n\nSaying movie of the year seriously makes me question what else you have seen.  Sinners? One Battle After Another? Hamnet? Sentimental Value? All better. I haven’t seen Train Dreams, No Other Choice, or Bugonia but I’ll probably like those more. Safdie and Chalamet are very talented no doubt, but it’s still a B- film.",

They get paid as both an actor and also as a producer.",
      "100%. Studios spend millions on PR. \n\nI’ve seen Marty supreme. It’s a decently solid movie, it was paced well and it was directed with a clear and clean objective. The acting was good too, all around the entire cast was pretty good. Timmy was good, but he wasn’t great. And this film and Timmy, in my opinion, do not hold the same cultural, or societal impact that other current films/performances hold right now. \n\nI felt that Timmy’s performance in a complete unknown, was a far better performance than his turn in Morty supreme. In my opinion, Gwyneth stole the movie. And she stole ever seen she was in. She single-handedly out-acted Timmy because she was a bit more lived in her performance. And At times it was apparent that Timothée Chalamet was delivering a performance, as opposed to, watching Marty supreme come to life. \n\nJust my opinion",

In order for someone in a duo to then direct a movie solo they basically have to leave the guild as a duo then reregister solo. There are rules in place to make it difficult to go from solo back to a duo because they don’t want people going back &amp; forth like that. \n\nSo with say the Safdies or the Coens, the duo splitting for them to do solo projects should be seen as indefinite rather than temporary.

      "If the Coens have proven anything to us it's that this isn't a great idea.",
      "I think with the Safdie's Josh was always the pivitol director while Benny acted also- that's not to say that Benny didn't have input on the direction of the films. Josh was the writer, Benny was the editor. They worked very close together. Smashing Machine is all D/W/P/E by Benny. Josh is D/W/P for Marty, relying- for his first time, on an editor that isn't his brother/ co-director. \n\n  \nWe're in for a ride folks.",
      "It's hard to quantify these things, but that editor is Ronald Bronstein, who's been their co-writer and co-editor for 15 years, on all of their movies. \"The Safdie Brothers\" is really a filmmaking trio but he always gets left out of the conversation because Bronstein's not a director.\n\nBenny's breaking off on his own but Josh and Bronstein are continuing on doing \"Safdie Brothers\" stuff just the two of them. Benny said that the Uncut Gems follow-up with Adam Sandler that they were supposed to direct together was entirely written by Josh and Bronstein with no input from him, and now he probably won't direct it either. I think he's happy collabing with Nathan Fielder and acting for Christopher Nolan instead.",

The orange ping-pong balls were invested by the one &amp; only person who believed in Marty, but since the film is about the horrors of pride &amp; ego, Marty loses everything, including the only person who believed in him. His friend then chucks all the balls out the window, and at the end of the film, Marty loses everything despite proving to himself that he is the best.

Guaranteed. \n\nBut fwiw I really like the A24 releases &amp; especially now that Criterion has been sunsetting the combo pack there is little reason to hope it goes to Criterion anyway.

The only ‘catch’ is that you have to have purchased them from A24 directly. \n\nBut if you did indeed purchase any physical from A24 you can log into the A24 app (the one for ‘members’ but you do not need to be a member just use your normal login that you use for their site) &amp; your digital copies should be in your library. It isn’t a code thing like most digital copies. \n\nIt only worked for a few of mine automatically but I emailed them about it, they asked for order numbers, &amp; they were added to my library within minutes of sending the order numbers.",
      "What’s usually in a criterion combo pack ?",

He’s so laser focused on one thing that he doesn’t see the big opportunities slip by. So many examples in the movie, but the orange balls are one of them. He could’ve been richer than Oleary’s character.",
      "Oooh, that's a good point. I was wondering what the reason for the ping pong balls were beyond being branded with the same name as the movie, but that definitely makes sense.

You’d never do that unless you were desperate. Marty is desperate to play this game and win. He is willing to lick honey off a man’s chest for the taste of sugar.",
      "Yeah, this is closer to the intent IMO. The story is told right after Rockwell had just said with seeming resentment, \"my son died for you.\" They didn't seem to feel particularly bad for Rockwell: the honey story clarifies that the son's death was a drop in the bucket of WWII suffering.\n\n\nMarty wasn't in WWII, but he grew up on those stories and learned that survival could mean fighting dirty. ",

      "I thought he was gonna say that while he was getting &gt;!spanked!&lt;. \n\n\"This one is for my son...\"\n\nI was fully expecting him to say better give me one for &gt;!fucking your wife!&lt; 🤣",
      "I thought Rockwell was gonna say the same thing that he knew about it the whole time or something",
      "I love how many regular-ass looking people the Safdies put in their movies, and also very striking but not famous people. Plus the cameos were hilarious. Why the fuck was Penn Gillette the farmer 😂",
      "And Isaac Mizrahi as gwenyth’s manager! Lol",
      "The bar is so low for seeing realistic ugly people in films that the crumbs we get from safdie feel like a full damn meal. Were used to seeing perfect hunger gamesque freaks in every movie now",
      "The Everybody Wants to Rule the World needle drop for the credits was perfect",
      "Forever young opening was peak",
      "“Welcome to your life!” With babies crying made me audibly laugh. I remember that moment in my own life. ",
      "The scene in the park was such a gritty reality . The idea that yes in a movie world it would just be some intense sexual encounter and both of them would run away holding hands laughing . But the reality is they got caught and Kay was mortified and embarrassed.",
      "Then immediately being devastated by the veil of ignorance being lifted on her shit play.",
      "My friend and I laughed at her opening line. Like the accent… I was sad that she was not self-aware enough to see the forest for the trees 😩😩",
      "I loved Marty IMMEDIATELY asking her for another necklace right after they needed to bribe the cops with the one she gave him. \n\nLike by that point all of his pride was gone which is what made him literally getting embarrassingly paddled on his bare ass in a party all the more logical right after.",
      "I absolutely loved this one. In classic Safdie brother fashion, Josh has managed to make a movie centered around a morally reprehensible character a thrill to watch from start to finish. However that wouldn’t be possible without Timothée Chalamet’s incredible performance. I mean wow, I knew he had the chops from his previous roles but this was next level. Marty is a narcissist, cheater, deadbeat, compulsive liar, thief, and so much more but even then I found myself rooting for the guy. I don’t think that would be possible without what Chalamet brings to the role.\n\nEveryone else brought their A-game too, and I was thoroughly impressed by Odessa A’zion’s performance here (having not seen any of her other roles before this). The score was top-notch as well, and it all perfectly culminates in that classic Safdie pacing where I constantly felt like the walls were closing in around me, just like they were for Marty. The dude has that Trump-like quality where he just manages to get out of any sticky situation that he finds himself in, though. When it cut to him boarding that military plane to get back to New York at the end I couldn’t help but laugh. No wonder he was a good salesman! \n\nFinally, I appreciated that this one didn’t get as dark as Uncut Gems and Good Time. It was nice to get an ending that finally showed us Marty has a heart somewhere deep down inside.",
      "Two minor thoughts I had at the end.\n\nFirst, a little miffed they didn't bring out the orange ball at the end considering both were wearing white and it would have been a chance to redeem his relationship with his friend if they got paid for that investment.\n\nSecond, and not sure if I'm as committed to this one, but if Marty lost the end and had the same exact same reaction to Endo (saying that Endo would win and all that and being humble), the ending would have been sold to me a little better? I'm not fully convinced that Marty has changed enough to be the father he needs to be. I don't think anything else would really need to change with him losing, thinking back. \n\nAnyway, really liked the film. Definitely my favorite of the year.",
      "I don't think he changed by the end either. After learning he couldn't compete and wasted his time coming to Tokyo, he accomplished his goal how he could... beating Endo and proving that even if Endo wins the championship, he beat him. \n\nHe doesn't want to go back, he doesn't have a choice. He doesn't want to settle down. He doesn't want to be a father. And that's why he's crying, and why the baby cries continue  into the credits. \n\nA cool thing I heard Josh Safdie say was that the music is 80s because in his head the story is being told when Marty is middle aged, reflecting.. which would be in the 80s.. so I'm taking it as he does end up changing, we just don't see it, we only hear it in the lyrics of the 80s music he's currently reflecting on.",
      "I'm not fully convinced that he was crying because he didn't want fatherhood. He seemed excited and happy at the end. His face wasn't ambiguous at all. He seemed genuine coming back to Rachel and saying he loves her and taking ownership of being the father. All of that was the opposite of what we had seen from the rest of the movie, so it definitely seemed like they were trying to show his change. Like, if Marty didn't want to be a father, he could just run like he did during the rest of the movie. I also definitely don't think the babies crying were meant to incite terror or anxiety lol. \n\nI think fatherhood is the ultimate symbol of living for something outside of yourself. I think they wanted to show that journey to the end in Marty, and maybe him winning the game was a way to \"unstuck\" himself from the mental block of losing the first time? But you're right I'm not convinced he's come that far. It seemed more symbolic at the end than it did the actual conclusion of the story?",
      "Kevin O’Leary was actually really good lmao",
      "I thought so too. has been acting for years on shark tank. I’m not surprised that he fit in well here",
      "I genuinely love that Chalamet approaches acting like an athlete. He’s phenomenal in this movie, deserves all the praise he’s getting, and I’m happy he’s talking his shit.",
      "It was really cool to see Ted Williams (aka The Man with the Golden Voice) have a small part in the movie",
      "I was really confused by how they even found him. He’s been hustling in Columbus for years, usually hanging around gas stations and singing a song for a few bucks. Crazy pull.",
      "I love the random casting choices. NBA hall of famer George Gervin? Sure, why not?\n\nAlso, was the guy who worked at the front “desk” of the ping pong place the homeless guy “with the golden voice” who went viral a few years ago?",
      "Yes, Ted Williams",
      "The way I saw the end Marty beats Endo and proves to himself that he is the best player in the world.\n\nHe comes back and accepts what he denied earlier. He might be fucked with the law and all the people he screwed over, and he didnt achieve his grandiose goals, but he's at least making the first step to being a better person and thinking about someone other than himself.",
      "It’s not even like Marty left a terrible life. The movie opens with him being named manager of a business, something he didn’t even work towards. He’s an excellent salesman. He’s got great business acumen. The orange ping pong ball idea *was* pretty smart and he even secured the initial investment from the pitch. He was able to charm a former movie star. He was also the second best ping pong player in the world. He had a ton of things going for him. \n\nThe problem is he needed everything to be perfect the way he envisioned it. He was blinded by purpose and had enough hubris to fill an ocean. I wanted him to just take one moment at any point in the film to breathe and take stock. He only *finally* does that at the very end of the movie.",
      "Got startled by the bathtub falling down. I knew the hotel worker warned about the bathroom, but totally did not expect the bathtub to fall through the floor and that's when I knew this movie was getting good.",
      "What's funny too is all of this happens because Marty wanted to save $1.50 so he'd have more money to hustle with, he could have got the room with the working bathroom if he paid a little more money.\n\nI love Abel Ferrara's introduction, too. He walks into the movie with a dog covered in shit, and is an asshole to everybody he interacts with. Even later in the movie in the car when he tells his lackey Mitch to shut up. He's just an asshole to absolutely everyone.",
      "Things i Did not expect to see in this movie: Timothée Chalamet bent over and spanked in front of a bunch of business men at a high end event.",
      "BUT IS THE DOG OKAY?",
      "right? the bathtub being on top of the dog gave me more anxiety than anything else in the movie",
      "Countless good things to say about the movie, but I’ll start with this - the score absolutely slapped",
      "The use of music whether through score or a throwback made so many moments.",
      "His friend throwing the ping pong balls out of the window was my favorite part of the movie. ",
      "That ending with the baby was perfect.\n\nMaybe it was just me, but I thought the baby looked wayyyy more like Ira than Marty. And almost the exact moment that thought crossed my mind, the camera cuts back to Marty and you see it flicker across his face too; he goes from relief and awe to something way more complicated. Doubt, recognition, maybe the realization that he never had the upper hand. Unbelievable acting by Chalamet. \n\nWhat makes it land is that Rachel is basically Marty’s character mirror throughout the entire film. She lies, hustles, and schemes her way into getting what she wants, and for once he’s the one left holding the fallout. The fake black eye, the baby, the mess…it’s Marty’s playbook, except he’s the one caught holding bag in the end.\n\nPerfect Safdie ending. Felt like closure and a warning at the same time.",
      "Very entertaining.\n\nNot entirely sure what I think of the ending. Marty is a pretty one-note character throughout the film, in a way that is very similar to the protagonists of *Good Time* and *Uncut Gems*, but whereas those guys both arrive at a point of total ruination as a result of all their bad decisions, Marty's ending seems to suggest a genuine shift in his character, and one that I don't know that I really buy based on what we've seen to this point.\n\nKevin O'Leary is traitorous scum, but he's pretty good in this movie, I regret to say.",
      "Something I noticed on second viewing was how Marty's mother is asleep in his bed when Marty sneaks into the house to grab the trophy to batter Ira with. So when she left orange juice in his room earlier, I guess it's implied she sleeps there often. I guess she really misses him.",
      "I honestly thought it was a ping pong movie. When he fell through the floor in the bathtub I realized I was in for a different kind of ride",
      "I can't get over what a crazy change in fortune it was for Marty to be cucking a millionaire prick and an hour later end up getting a bare-assed spanking from him.",
      "may thy paddle chip and shatter",
      "I was hyped as hell for this movie, EXCEPT when it came to the supporting cast. Reading the list of big names made me feel like they were all kind of gimmick castings. \n\nI’m pleased to say I was really, really wrong on that. \n\nKevin O’Leary specifically, I thought, why the fuck are we giving this asshole billionaire an acting job? But I have to admit he was such a perfect stand-in for capitalism. \n\n“You have no power here”\n\n“You’ll never be happy”\n\nSent a chill down my spine.",
      "Loved how Safdie turned ping-pong into a full anxiety sport, felt like Uncut Gems with paddles. Chalamet was insanely good. Highly recommend watching real Marty Reisman interviews after, they’re wild.",
      "Can we talk about Endo’s silence (deafness/ cultural and personal humility) juxtaposed to Marty’s nonstop chatter and chaos?\n\nIt was like yin and yang. Endo is everything Marty is not. \n\nEndo not only knew, but RESPECTED Marty and his talent enough to give him a real game, even AFTER what the US did to his country and the shameful display Marty showed when he lost.\n\nHe had absolutely NOTHING to gain from allowing him to honourably compete, and everything to lose!!\n\nMarty is out there for himself and his loved ones. Endo had the whole nation of Japan looking at him to instill some pride and happiness after arguably one of the worst, most egregious, acts of terrorism/war in existence.\n\nThat is what I’m stuck on. The honour of fair sportsmanship covering over the unthinkable. Fuck……\n\nBetween Endo and The previous champion (Honey Yeshua) I can’t decide which character I admire more….",
      "I Love LA back to back with Marty Supreme is enough to convince anyone Odessa A’zion is next up. This movie is a banger.",
      "I liked it but didn't love it. \n\nI thought the first and third acts were the most compelling. All the hijinks in the middle with the dog and grifting in the bowling alley got almost too chaotic that it felt like it lost the through line with his character arc. But I recognize the hijinks are patented Safdie, and also gave us more insight into Rachel.\n\nI thought the sports scenes were incredibly well done. I wanted even more of that!\n\nAlso conflicted about the ending. If they were going for a redemption arc, I didn't think it felt earned based on Marty's actions. If you interpret it as crying because he's locked in now and can't follow his dreams or something to that effect, it becomes more believable, and through that lens I appreciate it more. Either way, I like that it's open to interpretation.",

I don't know who would be winning if both movies dropped at the same time.",

OBAA is more of an ensemble piece where Leo is the through line, but in the prologue, Teyanna is the driving force, and after the time jump, Chase is the main protagonist. Also, despite the online naysayers who love to talk about how they don’t think Chalamet is that great, the industry clearly believes he is a great actor, and anointing someone in his generation who is both talented and able to get people to movie theaters in this moment is probably seen as good for the movies.",
