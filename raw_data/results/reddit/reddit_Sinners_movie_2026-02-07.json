    "Ben Stiller questions Variety's reporting of 'Sinners' box office performance: \"In what universe does a 60 million dollar opening for an original studio movie warrant this headline?\"": [
      "I'm too lazy to check, but this is the highest opening for an original live-action IP in a super long time, no?\n\n(Oppenheimer is based on a book).",
      "yep, even beating nope's $44m ow from 2022",
      "that is impressive",
      "eh, not really because they didn't turn a profit on opening day.\n\n\\--Variety, apparently.",
      "I wonder if that's before or after that objective bullshit that is Hollywood accounting.\n\n\nRyan Coogler also got a very strong deal out of this film,  WB is absolutely willing to do anything to make sure Ryan loses.  This is the same studio that regularly cans projects for tax write offs. I almost guaranteet his article is a paid hit piece",
      "The biggest opening since Us ($71M) in 2019.",
      "Damn so Black horror films are just crushing this decade",
      "I've seen enough sketch comedy about black Americans response to horror to get why.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jFkus2_SXVI?si=GSBwDHI94A98nBFz",
      "This is not comedy. It's just . . . truth.",
      "If you liked Sinners, check out Interview with the vampire (TV show)",
      "So it's especially impressive in the post-COVID era.",
      "and a real life person/story, definitely not original imo",
      "what?",
      "Obviously Sinners is based on a real life story \n\n/s",
      "I hate when my party gets ruined by a bunch of vampires.",
      "They’re obviously responding to the Oppenheimer part of the message",
      "wasn’t obvious to me :(",
      "Also, I think it's ratings are crazy high for a horror movie.",
      "He’s right. Variety making it sound like the movie is dead and has no chance of profitability.\n\nMaybe it will make money, maybe it won’t (especially given the lack of international interest), but a near-$50m DOM opening for an original movie doesn’t deserve to be caveated with “oh but it won’t make any money so why bother even making these”",
      "Sinners probably didn’t do an ad spend with Variety. ",
      "Every mass-media writer and editor has an agenda, some are just more transparent than others.",
      "“agenda” is doing some heavy lifting when you throw such a big blanket. ",
      "The studio heads are trying to downplay any success it has because they don't want directors to get ideas from this. Ryan Coogler has a clause in the contract that says he gets the rights to the movie after 20 or 25 years, so this movie being successful now scares the hell of of the execs.\n\nEdit for clarification. I meant that it scares the big studio execs who pinch every penny they have, not the ones that signed the deal with Coogler.",
      "He also earns money immediately. The contract doesn't make him wait for the studio to recoup it's cost. He earns from the unitial box office sales.",
      "&gt; lack of international interest\n\nThere's barely any showings here in Germany and all of them are dubbed. I'd love to see it, but I want to see it in the original language and I can't.  \n\nUnrelated to this movie, but I check local cinemas for original language versions of movies every day and it's rare that something runs in my area, unless it's already expected to be huge. It was very different just five years ago and around 20 years ago, you could even find original language showings right here in my small city.",
      "On that note, some half-random fact, in Germany the movie appears to be called Blood &amp; Sinners. They love altering titles over here for no real reason, lol.",
      "Yeah, I know.   \n\nThere's some real cringy ass movie title translations here. \n\nThere was a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/2fi0qg/what_is_your_favorite_english_film_title_that_has/) about this on /r/germany lol",
      "I grew up in Trier and my father's German wasn't great so when we'd go to the cinema, we'd want to watch the English stuff in English. There wasn't anything in Trier, generally, that showed stuff in English so we'd head on over to Luxembourg. I told my daughter once that BACK IN MY DAY, we went to a completely different country to watch a movie and she that that was crazy",
      "Especially since the holds are about to become epic",
      "with the amazing WOM i cant see how it won’t be profitable after a few weekends",
      "The Accountant 2 comes out next weekend as well as the Revenge of the Sith re-release\n\n\nThunderbolts comes out the weekend after. It would have had less competition if it released at the beginning of the month. Minecraft had legs partly because nothing was competing against it ",
      "To be fair, **Thunderbolts** is probably not a direct competition.",
      "&gt;Revenge of the Sith re-release\n\nAm I misunderstanding the Sinners audience? I feel like it's playing to cinephiles that want to see it no matter what so why would a 20yr old rerelease that will only appeal to SW fans be a threat?",
      "I personally don’t think any of these directly compete with Sinners with in being in a different genre. *Maybe* Revenge of the Sith and Thunderbolts simply because of the age group that will likely be in attendance",
      "I saw billboards for it all over Mexico City a few weeks ago",
      "I think international interest might increase because of word of mouth. I’m from Portugal, saw it last week, and I’ve been recommending it to all of my friends. One of the best movies I’ve seen in recent years.",
      "There are adverts for it everywhere here in the UK.",
      "Lack of international interested?\nHere in Brazil the marketing is non existent and still a lot of people are going to see it. I'm having trouble getting a ticket.",
      "TBH, I am on a neighboor country to you and the first time hearing about this movie was this post.",
      "heck not even just original but an original horror movie staring a black guy in this climate. heck due to its relatively sane budget isnt it like over 1/3 the way to the money point after this even?",
      "Thank you for reminding me that I need to watch Severance S2.",
      "I haven't watched it at all yet, trying to finish up with Shrinking. But everyone at my workplace keeps talking about it, anytime I opened up socials the last month or so my entire feed seemed to be people losing their minds over it. I just have SO much backlog of what I have to watch...",
      "Your backlog will still be there after you watch Severance S2",
      "Put your backlog on hold and watch severance season 2.",
      "My wife and I just finished Shrinking last night. We both very much enjoyed it.",
      "Thanks for reminding me I need to watch severance s1",
      "Ask all the other original flicks to come out the last year, 60 opening would be a dream. This is a massive success for the film and one where they don't have any direct competition until Thunderbolts.",
      "Seemed like it had a limited release too. Some theaters in my city only had it for the weekend. ",
      "Going to see it next week at the only cinemark that is showing it in 70mm near me.  It was front row only that all weekend at the only cinemark that supported the format, and we do not sit in the first 3 rows. &gt;\\_&gt;",
      "what is with Variety’s hate-boner for this movie?",
      "Penske Media owns all the major trades - Deadline, Variety, Rolling Stone, The Hollywood Reporter (it technically only runs operations here, doesn’t own it). These outlets are all pretty much studio mouthpieces. And a movie where the filmmaker has the rights revert to him after 25 years is probably making a lot of execs anxious.",
      "I think that Coogler got caught in the middle of the war to oust DeLuca and Abdy who approved that deal. It isn't really about the deal or Coogler but looking for narrative to finish those 2 off cause they bounced back with Minecraft. By undermining Sinners success, they get painted as reckless with the budget again. It's clear that a lot is going on in the background unrelated to the movie's actual performance hence the headscratcher headlines.",
      "You might be right. As we have seen in recent weeks, studios have gone to increasingly unhinged ways of playing out turf wars.",
      "I mean sure it could be deeper but on surface value hating on anything trending is guaranteed rage clicks.  It's almost become the modus operandi for all modern social media.",
      "I’m going to sound ignorant here, is this not a common deal for directors when writing their own stories?   At least when it comes to established directors like Coogler, I would have assumed he’d have the rights anyway at this point",
      "This is actually extremely rare in the industry; I’ve only heard of a couple other directors having a similar agreement for maybe one of their films. Tarantino and Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood, for example",
      "No, which is why they're trying to smear it. I'm going to try and get a few people together to see the movie this week since we couldn't do it due to the Easter weekend and travels. But creators wanting to own their filmography is something that should happen more often. Nolan, Villeneuve and others of their calibre might start demanding such deals in the future which is why the studios don't want Sinners to succeed.",
      "Wouldn’t it be good for execs to front load their profits in the first 25 years then? Shouldn’t they be cheering them on? Honestly how many execs actually care about the profitability of their mothership in 25 years? Why would they? They will likely be retired or at a different company anyway and their bonus likely won’t be tied to 25 year old movie profits.",
      "It's not common in a lot of creative industries. For example, Image Comics in the 90s was a big deal, because the IP would be creator-owned. This was hugely different from the way that DC and Marvel worked. Imagine a world where Marvel/Stan Lee didn't completely screw over Jack Kirby.",
      "Some execs are afraid that Ryan Coogler's deal could change the industry.",
      "https://i.redd.it/ut742bsci7we1.gif\n\nAww they're afraid. Womp womp",
      "Coogler put dirt in some exec's eye",
      "Coogler is the little girl that Stack taught to negotiate.\n\nEdit: sorry, guys, but all Michael B. Jordans look alike to me.",
      "Which is stupid. Only a handful of filmmakers have the cache of a Ryan Coogler. Jared Hess isn’t getting a deal like this when negotiating for Minecraft 2.",
      "Yea, but those handful of directors include people like Christopher Nolan, Denis Villeneuve and others of their caliber who have the potential to deliver films that would be timeless classics in 30 years. \n\nAs it stands, a Sinners 30th anniversary home video release is something that only Coogler and the distributor who organizes the release will benefit from.",
      "Not even to deal with the fact that that one is a licensed IP, I don't think the studios' concern would be one-offs like that. It would be that the next time they are negotiating a new contract with DGA, this is a demand the directors will make the hill they are willing to die on. \n\nEspecially as people making the movies get more upset about the direction corporations are taking the film industry, I could see the directors guild trading the stance that the rights to original films should revert to the creators after a period similar to what copyright originally was.",
      "Didn't Tarantino made a similar deal with Sony when he directed Once upon a time? What is the difference now?",
      "He had the exact same deal.",
      "I doubt it, even coogler admits it's primarily symbolic since it doesn't take effect for decades.",
      "I don’t think so because a filmmaker will have to earn a lot of goodwill to have the leverage for such a deal. Took QT 8 films before he got it for OUATIH. Coogler made studios billions already.",
      "&gt; Took QT 8 films before he got it for OUATIH\n\nHonestly this could be exactly what has them so nervous. It's one thing to give this to QT. He's one of the most well known directors around, he has a long track record, and perhaps most importantly his movies are more valuable for the prestige they're bringing the studio than the money. Don't get me wrong, his movies make money, but he's not a particularly commercial director.\n\nCoogler, on the other hand, has a much shorter track record and most of his success has come with franchise movies. If he's demanding this type of deal it really widens who's going to get them, while also increasing the downside for the studios because they're losing rights to more commercial work that has more financial value to them.\n\nAnd I hope that happens. I would love to see creators have more control over their work.",
      "I have not been following all the headlines for this movie, but every trade (plus major news like NYT &amp; WSJ) have been ragging on WB for the two months since there has been internal leaks that Zaslav is worried about De Luca/Abdy's movie strategy. My sense is this is just a continuation of that since Sinners along w/ Mickey 17, One Battle After Another, and The Bride! were the targets of Zaslav's concerns.",
      "Right - it’s not just this movie it’s every movie from Mike and Pam. It’s contrived and annoying, but continuing the pile on when a movie did amazingly well is just evidence that it’s a campaign.",
      "Variety works for Hollywood executives. They present and shape a narrative that beneficial to studio executives.\n\nEdit: why does Variety do this? For exclusive access. Similar to the NYTs, WSJ and Fox News’s relationship with the Pentagon.",
      "Yeeeeeessssss!!!!!!!! You made me connect something I hadn't before. You are spot on about variety's service to studio execs. Variety was at the forefront of the Rachel Zegler hate campaign blaming her for the poor performance of Snow White even though she was the best part of the movie. This was due to Marc Platt being furious about Rachel Zegler's 'free Palestine' tweet and she refused to take it down to the point he flew to New York to admonish her but she stood her ground and clearly Marc took aim for her career.\n\n\nRyan coogler's deal for Sinners has a first dollar agreement where Ryan will start getting a cut of sales from the opening weekend of the movie. Usually, the studio makes it's money back first and then they will start paying back end deals. Also the ownership of sinners will revert back to Ryan coogler after 25 years, which is makes sinners an IP that the company is eventually going to lose. Also, to get sinners greenlit Ryan pit studios against each other with a bidding war to get a higher budget for the film so the studio might have ended up paying more for the movie than the intended. Ryan coogler also demanded to have the final cut edit for the film.\n\n\nthese terms are favourable to Ryan yes but not to the execs.  All these agreements are rare by themselves let alone for one picture and there is some executive who is not happy about this. So the next thing Is to set Ryan up for failure by setting the bar much higher than what's usual for these kinds of films (also considering that it's an original horror flick with a majority black cast). Seems like they are setting the stage to brand it a flop, Ryan's career takes a hit, he is knocked down a peg or three and he won't be able to make such high demands in the future. \n\n\nJudging from the Rachel Zegler campaign, I think this variety article is only the begining.",
      "It's becoming clear that someone doesn't want this movie to succeed, but who could it be?",
      "They seem to have some friends at both the Variety and the NY Times",
      "Maybe David Zaslav. Its possible the dude is seething that the people under him in Abdy and De Luca despite some misses have made significantly more successful movie decisions than the clown himself. His \"passion project\" was Alto Knights and that was a monumental bomb while Minecraft and Sinners in the same month are huge hits.",
      "I don't think this is coming from in house.\n\nThis really feels like other studio execs and old media personalities being opposed to this movie and the financial aspects around it (WB winning a bidding war, Coogler negotiating first dollar and future rights, big streaming deals already reported and agreed upon before the movie was released)",
      "This is it right here",
      "They complained about the Coogler deal and they also complained about WB spending \"too much\" in bidding wars in the Vulture article. I fully expect the weird coverage that has already started for One Battle After Another to increase tenfold when we get closer to release. God forbid that movie doesn't do well financially, they'll absolutely pounce. \n\nThey overplayed their hand this weekend, now it's just obvious to everyone. We've been rumbling about it on here for some weeks now how the coverage has been a bit off on both of these movies but with the OW being over expectations for Sinners and still getting this coverage, they made it too obvious. We're onto the game now. \n\nAnd now I'm even doubting that Zaslav even has a problem with De Luca and Abdy. It's actually very possible the outside agitators were trying to sow discord in the ranks and make everything look unstable at WB because they don't like what De Luca and Abdy have been doing.",
      "![gif](giphy|8lp6CW7K2fdDGn3xCQ)",
      "That's my other theory. The executives being worried about the rights to their films 25 years from now is hilarious now that the film looks to be a success because if the release was less than sublime, they would gladly sell off the streaming rights, take it off streaming for syndication, etc. just to make the dollar back. How dare they reward a filmmaker for putting his money where his mouth is and delivering.",
      "Agreed. I have less than zero respect for Zaslav but I doubt WB is any way angry about this. If Zaslav had any balls he would assure Coogler that while under WB he can make what he wants and tell other execs to piss off.",
      "You think David Zaslav is upset that WB has two major hit movies in one month because Alto Knights didn't do well so he is making publications put out hit articles that would downplay WB's recent success? Get a grip.\n\nAlso, it wasn't his passion project. It was a passion project of his friend of his, he just greenlit it.",
      "I get the zaslav hate, but that man isn’t mad about having two big hits in one month. You’re right",
      "Zaslav would never do that. He is the type of dude to brag to his friends about how Sinners was a success because of him.",
      "Hey, if you’re an original film post-COVID, gotta take what you can get.",
      "And its an original horror movie making it even more impressive",
      "he's right",
      "The real vampires have come out to play",
      "I actually think movies like Thunderbolts should be counting their blessings that they get a few weekends distance from Sinners, not the other way around.",
      "They hate that a black man owns the rights to his own movie.",
      "That's exactly what it is, Tarantino's last movie opened up with a similar amount of gross and didn't get scrutiny for it's first dollar gross deal, yet Coogler's movie opens and gets scrutiny from trades for the EXACT SAME DEAL !!!. Double standards going on here, and I think I know why.",
      "Once upon a time in Hollywood opened to about 95m globally, not 60m. Dont know how it compares exactly with which countries opening for each though.",
      "Fully agree with Ben Stiller here. Most stories these days seem to be about how movies have 'bombed'. It may get clicks, but it's the most lazy \"If it bleeds, it leads\"-style of journalism. It isn't even true, half the time. Sinners has only just begun its theatrical run.",
      "I might go see it again just for that",
      "Variety exercises the same brainrot that this sub does. Just because a film doesn’t immediately make back its budget in one weekend, doesn’t make it a failure, and certainly not an original film.",
      "The trades are owned by the same media conglomerate. Have you read the court documents of the Lively vs. wayfarer lawsuits / counter lawsuits? It’s a fascinating  look into the dirty laundry of PR people and the way Hollywood  money can buy even the New York Times. Anyone with a little bit of insight into how Hollywood operates knows media is a business and they're no exempt of receiving money to smear someone, but the blatant way the trades , NYT and Time magazine  are helping the Lively  parties,  is very telling. They aren’t even pretending Fair report privilege anymore.\n\nClearly a PR team from someone powerful angry at the Coogler deal is behind this. And unfortunately the lack of interest of the international market which affected also Mickey 17 in most markets will make them double down on week 2. Sinners is their Baldoni. **EDIT. There's evidence that Lively was the one attempting to smear Justin not the other way around, if you're not one of her PR turfs read the information available at court filing sites. Avoid the gossip, both sides have their turfs hers strongers than his, it's better to read directly from legal sources.** I just hope Sinners box office isn't affected by this smear campaign.",
      "The unusually aggressive early attempts to manufacture a box office narrative, IMO, seems like a combination of trades disgruntlement at Coogler's deal + some racism + yet another example of the NY Times continued and constant seething this decade at anything that they construe as culturally leftish"

      "When I was a bachelor my roommate and I would hit up the movies quite a bit.  Once we wanted to watch something on streaming.  I don't even recall what it was.  He wanted movie popcorn so we drove to the movie theater and bought one.  Popcorn dude asked what we were seeing and he said, \"At home?  Tell you what.  When this runs out you pause that shit and come back and I'll fill this up for you\"\n\nSo we did.  Fun times.  It 2008/2009 or so.",
      "My local AMC in on food delivery service platforms. I think it started during Covid but they have an at home popcorn “kit” which is a huge bag of popped corn and a squirt bottle full of fake butter. It’s a decadent expense but my girlfriend has a couple chronic illnesses that sometimes keep her bed bound for a few days so it’s worth it to have a little at home movie theater experience occasionally.",
      "That's very nice of you.  My ex roommate and I both work in industrial fields and joke that the synthetic movie theater butter is a better lubricant than you can find for most bearings.",
      "I really should be commenting on your rankings but I will just say that I admire you as a human for committing to the movies this much, and the fact that you've saved all your ticket stubs is a very attractive quality.  Nice work.",
      "OP do you work in media as a reviewer? How do you find the time?",
      "Most Americans spend hours a day consuming media. It’s just a matter of prioritizing film over tv/youtube/instagram",
      "This person's going to a million film festivals though and saved over a thousand ticket stubs. Far from your average cinema goer.\n\nMight be a reviewer.",
      "Idk, their last three years have been 325, 298, 290...sounds like they are slacking!",
      "Okay, it turns out Michael Bolton is a major cinephile.",
      "You complete me!",
      "Big, if true.",
      "How dare you",
      "Incredible...I thought I liked movies haha. \n\nGenuine question, what did you get out of watching One Battle After Another 7x? I loved it but I can't see what you are squeezing out of it to watch it that many times within a short period.",
      "OP is Sean Penn",
      "He's not gay. If that's what you asking.",
      "Maybe just horny",
      "we need more horny cinema",
      "I had never seen a movie in theaters more than 3x before **OBAA**. It's just so rewatchable for me. It totally flies by. You pick up new stuff each time (and to be fair the 7th time was because Regina Hall was announced as a last-minute Q&amp;A guest for the screening and there was no world where I was missing that).",
      "One one battle after another after another one battle after another.",
      "It's interesting how people's tastes are so different. I saw OBAA once and I wouldn't watch it again. I thought it was okay, but nothing special.\n\nMy most favourite movie experience was watching Heat a few years ago when TIFF reran it at midnight.\n\nReally appreciate your list, nice work.",
      "I watched it three times over like two weeks. I could watch it again.\n\n\nUp front it's just incredibly well paced. Like OP said it just flies by somehow. But there's so much attention to detail. There's so many small insignificant things that are given no highlights that come in later. I definitely think there's a strong argument for watching it twice because there's a lot of stuff with Bob at the start of the movie pre-kid that seems like dressing and knowing how he ends up and what he has to deal with makes it more interesting. And the performances are really good. Sean Penn is so goddamn weird but still grounded in a way that feels vaguely like I've met that kind of guy before. Leo being a struggling fuck up who's energy is at a 10 almost the whole movie is super entertaining. And in particular the whole segment where hes with Del Toro is amazing for what is happening as a whole. There is so much to take in between what Bob's doing, what Del Toro is doing, and what the background is doing. There's some really entertaining coregraphy for that whole portion of the movie.",
      "Choosing to voluntarily watch “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” more than once says a lot \n\nI liked that movie too, just pure anxiety the whole way",
      "That's one of the movies I'd probably never re-watch but [Rose Byrne was at the 2nd screening](https://i.imgur.com/1aTUE3q.jpeg) for Q&amp;A (along with the director Mary Bronstein) so I couldn't *not* go lol. There were tons of walkouts at that one though. Imagine walking out before Rose fucking' Byrne comes on for a Q&amp;A. Couldn't be me.\n\nThe movies that had the most walkouts this year:\n\n* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You**\n* **[The Chronology of Water](https://i.imgur.com/iRt4Y0a.jpeg)** (i swear at least 150 people walked out of this one)\n* **[The Testament of Ann Lee](https://i.imgur.com/HzGkRUj.jpeg)** \n\nThe first two make sense. Those movies are *aggressive*. They actively don't give a shit about your feelings. They want to make you feel like shit. **Ann Lee** makes no sense, nobody should be walking out of that. If you walk out of **Ann Lee** we can't be friends.\n\nSome of my favorite Q&amp;As of the year:\n\n* **[Hamnet](https://i.imgur.com/lz0ckDo.jpeg)** (Chloe Zhao, Paul Mescal, Jessie Buckley, Noah Nupe, Jacobi Jupe, Emily Watson)\n* **[I Love LA](https://i.imgur.com/LG1KBNe.jpeg)** (Rachel Sennott, Odessa A'Zion, True Whitaker)\n* **[Left-Handed Girl](https://i.imgur.com/PGUjHY0.jpeg)** (Shih-Ching Tsou, Nina Ye, Shih-Yuan Ma)\n* **[Highest 2 Lowest](https://i.imgur.com/Xw82HNO.jpeg)** (Spike Lee)\n* **[Blood for Dracula](https://i.imgur.com/Y4tPY9i.jpeg)** (Udo Kier, RIP)\n\nThe two biggest standing ovations I was a part of this year:\n\n* **[Christy](https://imgur.com/a/Bpr1MO4)** (Played really well at TIFF, not so much everywhere else)\n* **[Frankenstein](https://i.imgur.com/7kEFgcG.jpeg)** (There was probably 100+ cast/crew there for this one, including all of the big stars and GDT. It's a hometown movie (Toronto, for TIFF), so this was a no-brainer.)",
      "Holy shit. I wanted to go to that Q&amp;A at Lincoln Square. Shocked to read there were walkouts. It’s an intense movie like Uncut Gems…. But Rose should be nominated for Best Actress. I wouldn’t walk out on that potential Q&amp;A unless I was having a legit panic attack. ",
      "Q&amp;As are my favorite part of festivals so I stay whenever I can, even if I don't love the movie. Sometimes the Q&amp;A will even make up for a disappointing movie.",
      "why were there walkouts? can you tell me with the spoiler tag added. idc, I'm not going to actually watch it",
      "The one trailer I saw made it look like a fun comedy with Rose Byrne and Conan O'brien in it. \n\nThe actual movie is a woman with crumbling mental health having the world fall apart around her as her mental health deteriorates. It's more so sad and messed up that you end up laughing as a defense mechanism than a comedy. \n\nRoofman did a similar thing where the trailer made it look like a fun romcom with a wacky premise. The actual movie is super sad. \n\nIn my showings of both some people left like a third of the way through the movie.

Rachel, Odessa, and True were there for intro and Q&amp;A after:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rFmqM85.jpeg\n\nRachel also stayed to sign stuff after and got to say hi/get **Shiva Baby** signed:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qnE5rwG.jpeg\n\nReally fun time. She rocks.",
      "Absolutely incredible. I must ask, what is going on with Odessa's face?\n\nSide note: It's really neat to see a moderator of a sub have a real passion for what they moderate.",
      "Here are some reviews/thoughts I had to cut to fit the maximum character count:\n\n* **The Threesome** - 8/10 - Really really really great stuff. Smart, funny, heartfelt. It could be a really cheesy setup (threesome goes horribly wrong), but it takes lots of turns you don't expect and it's super smartly written and excellently acted (especially Zoey Deutsch). Sweet little comfort movie. Dope soundtrack too.\t\n\n* **Final Destination: Bloodlines** 8/10 - I've always had a soft-spot for the original, but the other movies didn't do much for me and I even skipped some. Was originally going to skip this one but really glad I didn't. A new high-point for the series. Kind of everything I want in a horror. Funny, surprisingly, nasty/hilarious kills. It subverts your expectations at every corner and has one of the best mic-drop endings of the year. Give me more\n\n* **Bring Her Back** - 8/10  Jesus christ. Really great horror film, and apart from one very weird/jarring/out-of-place tonal shift near the end (when there's the cleaning montage and the one-liner of the girl playing ball), it's consitent throughout.\t\n\n* **Christy** - 7/10 - It’s a boxing biopic with a tragic 2nd act and a happy ending. You’ve seen it a million times, but really solid lead performances from Sydney Sweeney (in her best role yet) and Ben Foster (at his most reviling) and a sweeping, war-movie-like orchestral score keep it engaging throughout. Chad Coleman only has a few minutes of screentime but he makes them memorable as Don King, highlight of the movie for me. In a just world, he’d get Supporting Actor Oscar buzz. \t\n\n* **The Surfer** - 7/10 - Pretty challenging watch and will test a lot of people's patience but it ultimately pays off, even though you're left with a lot of questions (in a good way). Another classic weird-Cage performance that builds up perfectly. Loved all of the extremely-uncomfortable close-ups. You doubt yourself for a lot of the movie which I really enjoyed.\t\n* **Blue Heron** - 7/10 - Canada's *We Need To Talk About Kevin*. Unfortunately, the subtitles weren't on during my screening so I probably missed some important stuff, but it's an impressive debut film with a complicated-but-well-done timeline.\t\n\n* **A Big Beautiful Journey** - 7/10 - Everyone hates it, I liked it. Yes it drags a bit in the middle and some of the 'visiting the past' scenes are weird (50-year old Colin Farrell confessing love to his 15-year old high school crush...?), and I would pay money for the 3-minute Burger King ad in the middle to not exist, but the soundtrack/needle drops were built in a lab specifically for me and there's a lot of sweet moments. It's corny in the best way, filled with goofy lines like \"I prefer to feel nervous with you than nothing alone\", which just kinda worked for me.\t\n\n* **The Wizard of the Kremlin** - 7/10 - There's a 9/10 movie in here somewhere with some better editing/pacing. Literally all of the first ~30 minutes can be cut. Jeffrey Wright can be cut, Alicia Vikander can be cut. Concentrate more on Putin and you've got a stew going. Right now, it's a bunch of solid potential and great performances that result in not much of anything. Paul Dano trying to play a teenager for a few scenes was very not good. Good movie, could be a lot better.\n\n* **On Swift Horses** - 7/10 - A bit long and melodramatic but kept you engaged enough (with two intertwined storylines) to keep it interesting. Daisy Edgar Jones is great (+ some steamy lesbian sex scenes for all u sick pervs). Kinda over Jacob Elordi's schtick though. He's played the same character for like 5 movies in a row. He's always just doing a James Dean impression.\t\n\n* **Rust** - 7/10 - Went in with rock-bottom expectations but it was surprisingly solid. Very well writen and well shot, with solid performances (especially Travis Fimmel, one of the best supporting performances of the year so far). It's definitely a bit slow and long (most people will get bored), but the dialogue really works and there's a lot of depth to the worldbuilding. Hard to ignore the tragedy during the movie though, the movie starts off with someone accidentally shooting someone and you're just like \"oof\".\t\n\n* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You** - 6/10 - Rose Byrne puts in an incredible performance and is supported by a great cast, especially Conan O’Brien and ASAP Rocky) who’s starting to pop up and standout in lots of things recently), but the constant close-ups and confusing drug &amp; alcohol-induced blow-ups keep it from going great. They got a bit repetitive. The smashed-hamster to lasagna sequence was top-tier as far as transitions go though. \t\n\n* **Hard Truths** - 5/10 - Introduces you to possibly the most irritating character ever put on the big screen (and not in a good way like *Naked*), with zero redeeming qualities and no arc, with a frustratingly pointless ending. Very very rough. I know that Mike Leigh won't hold your hand and answer all of the questions, but sheesh, I needed something more. Huge disappointment.\n\n* **Fuze** - 5/10 -  I haven’t seen a third act derailment this bad since *White Noise*. Just a total mess in the last 30 minutes that completely kills a somewhat-decent premise. I don't know if David Mackenzie has another *Hell or High Water* in him.\n\n* **Eastern Western** - 3/10 - If you thought Kevin Costner's *Horizon* was slow, wait until you get a hold of this. The hardest I had to fight to slay asleep all year. Would make for a good white noise machine to fall asleep.\t\n\n* **High Rollers** - 3/10 - You'll see a lot of people joke about movies being money laundering schemes, but this could *actually* be one. The director, Randall Emmett, is probably the shadiest dude in Hollywood. He keeps bankrolling John Travolta's straight-to-the-garbage-bin movies somehow. A documentary about how his films are made would undoubetdly be more interesting than this trash.\n\n* **Good American Family** - 3/10 - Garbage streaming true-crime slop. Very messy. It wants to be serious and dark but it's so cartoony and poorly executed. It's filmed like a car commercial. But Mark Duplass is the champion of indie film so I'll always support. He basically admitted (several times) during the Q&amp;A that he basically took this gig to fund his more serious, indie films.",
      "I only saw 23 movies this year but that was a record for me. One of them was The Surfer and I think you're being overly generous here. Pretty much the whole cinema was like WTF did we just watch (and it was filmed in our state).  RIP Julian McMahon though, I guess that was his last role.",

I don’t rate individual TV episodes but I’ll rate a series I’ve seen a lot of. I also rate short films. Out of 4849 ratings:\n\n10 - 1092  \n8 - 1802  \n6 - 1403  \n4 - 463  \n2 - 82  \n\nBasically 10: “fantastic! I want to see it again!”, 8: “Quite enjoyed it and would happily watch again.”, 6: “Decent or Ok but I don’t need to see it again.”, 4: “Meh, you tried, but I’d decline if asked to rewatch.”, and 2: “Properly terrible or so bad I couldn’t finish it.” \n\nIt’s really more a way of keeping track of what I’ve watched.",

      "Our tastes clearly differ in some respects, so YMMV, but somehow apparently neither of my favourite films so far this year (*caveat*: have not yet seen Sentimental Value, Hamnet or Marty Supreme) were among your 290.\n\nI highly recommend both The Kingdom (Le Royaume), a Corsican gangster movie from the perspective of a mob boss's teenage daughter, and The Sun Rises on US All, a Chinese drama about a woman whose ex unexpectedly resurfaces in her life – I don't think it's had a general release, but it was at TIFF. ",

I spent a year avoiding trailers/discussion threads/recaps/Wiki plot synopses and my movie-going experience improved dramatically. We've lost surprise nowadays. There are so many moments that would've landed like a nuclear strike if I hadn't already seen them in trailers over the years, I highly recommend this strategy to people. It can be difficult to avoid spoilers, but it's not impossible.",
      "I'm the same way, I avoid trailers whenever I can. Depending on the chain, I'll show up 10-20 minutes past showtime so I can skip as many trailers as possible. Other than a synopsis and knowing who's involved, I go in as blind as possible to every movie.",

It's like a 6/10 movie at best, with one or *maybe* two incredible sequences saving basically the entire thing from being a total disaster.\n\n(OP also gives Jurassic World Rebirth a 7/10, and it's probably the worst film I saw this year, so I'm guessing this list is not going to be particularly helpful for me...)",
      "Agreed, the whole Entity storyline is colossally stupid, Gabriel is the biggest nothingburger villain I've seen in a long time, and the guy got two whole movies! The writing is clunky as all hell. The submarine and plane sequences are good but far too much of the movie is just plain bad.",

I mostly disagree but cant blame them, the plot is a bit all over the place.\n\nI will say they do shadow and maria way better than the games and thats the main reason i disagree from the rating, if i ignore my fan bias and just look at the disjointed story. Its not just a sick child and her protector, its a mischievous granddaughter and an innocent alien becoming best friends. They are a little on the nose with the antithesis of sonic and shadow, but if you look at them each independently they are both good. \n\nThe other part i will praise is jim carey played two very similar characters very differently. Ivo is evil but almost innocent with his trust, gerald is broken and beyond saving. They are truly different characters.",

A multi-billion dollar franchise (multiple sequels, cross-media, and an entire amusement park) shot in the head before it even had a chance.",

None of the movies listed did that; no one was going on youtube or facebook or Insta and repeatedly seeing any of these.\n\nContrast that with that dreadful Sidney Sweeny-Glen Powell thing last year which was on every fucking website, app and social media site, with her in a bikini.

Except by the second weekend, there were no more 70mm showings of it at either of the theaters near me. They canned it completely after the first weekend and used the screens they had that could handle 70mm and were using them for regular showings. AFAIK, the only reconfiguration between 70mm and 35mm for these theaters was just curtain positioning, And the curtains are electronically controlled so they can just switch between the two formats quickly.\n\nI get that 70mm is even more specialized than IMAX and has an even smaller following, but still: one weekend only? I suspect the problem is a mixture of studios being very risk adverse, too sensitive to let something ride for a bit of it's not an immediate smash success, but I think another post of the proven is theaters are so sensitive to empty seats that they simply can't tolerate a film that isn't pulling people in at any given showing.",

So it means I'm less likely to find a movie to watch, which means I'm not building up my habit of going to see movies. They need to keep movies off streaming platforms for longer to keep more choices in theaters longer, to build back the habits of feeling like I need to go to a theater to see a movie. Additionally, this SHOULD mean theaters make more money so they don't have to bump up ticket/concession prices so much either.",
      "Yeah in the 90s if you were bored you could just go to the multiplex and figure out what to watch from there. \n\nhttps://www.boxofficemojo.com/season/summer/1993/\n\nThat is a list of movies that were in theaters in ONE summer in the 90s, there were a lot of bangers but in a way they didn't really cancel each other out or even compete with each other because it's not like you had to choose which ones to see, even if you only went on the discounted night of the week (Tuesdays where I was) because they were mostly in theaters for a long time. \n\nBut, I do get the realities of business. Theaters can't stay open when they run too many empty shows. But I think maybe giving some of the less popular movies ONE showing a week for a few more weeks, rather than none, could be a good way to keep up a good variety and get more out of each movie made.",
      "It's not even the less popular movies, it's almost all movies now that are gone after a week or two. It's the rare one offs that stick around for more then 2 weeks now.",
      "Absolutely agreed on not building up a habit of going to see movies. \n\nMy wife and I, like many people, stopped going to movies for the first two years of the pandemic. Then we had a kid, which meant mostly the end of our social life for a while. When we finally got some breathing room and had the occasional night free when someone else could watch the kid, we’d check out the local movie theaters and there would be so few movies playing. And any exciting movie that we had been hearing about that we had missed the opening weekend two weeks ago was already gone. \n\nSo we’ve mostly stopped even thinking about going to movies on “date nights” anymore.",
      "There is a serious awareness problem with these films. This post is literally the first time I've heard of most of these movies. \n\nIt doesn't matter how original or good a movie is if nobody knows it's out there to be seen, and with theater attendance generally down, walk-in attendance from just showing up and seeing the poster isn't a reliable way to get people in seats.",
      "It doesn't help that they're only in theaters 2 weeks then disappear. \n\nDeath of a Unicorn looked really interesting. However, wife and I hate going opening weekends because of crowds.  Last weekend didn't work out because of other commitments interfering with the two showtimes available to us. (We're 50, we're not going to a 10:45 showing.)\n\nThis weekend? Nothing. Three weeks in the movie's gone and now we'll just catch it on streaming later. \n\nHowever, Minecraft had about 25 showings a day. Repeat this cycle for many, many movies.",

Maybe it's not the fact that it's an \"original idea\" or \"consumers prefer established settings\"... Maybe the movie plot is just terrible?",
      "??? Red One did NOT struggle.\n\n\nIt was a Christmas movie released around Thanksgiving and people already knew it was going to be streaming by Christmas. \n\nRed One clearly had contractual obligations with Dwayne Johnson to release in theaters before the streaming market.",

      "I live in NYC. Ordered online, a ticket for a standard film (not 3D or \"Lie-MAX\") comes to $25. Add the insane price of snacks onto that, and my days of going to the theater on a whim are long behind me.",
      "Then they got the nerve to tack on a convience fee for buying tickets digital.",
      "That's 90 percent of the economy these days. Add on fees wherever you can, make them egregious, but unavoidable, and ignore the constant complaints.\n\nThe only way to avoid them is to buy these bullshit subscriptions to certain theaters. And unless you live right next door to a major theater, who the hell is going to pay for that?",
      "A few years ago I tried to avoid an insane convenience fee by going to the theater when a event that was going to sell out immediately went on sale. They don't sell tickets at the box office. I had to rush to a computer and pay a fee to get them. Why have a box office? If it's the only way to get them, how is it convenient?",
      "It’s convenient because they tell you it is, and you’ll like it.",
      "That could be considered a Visa or MasterCard rules violation. Generally, convenience fees should only be applied to payments made outside of a merchant's normal payment channel. If they don't have a way to avoid the fee, they could get fined by the card brands. It's different if it's just a surcharge applied regardless of payment channel. At which point they shouldn't be calling it a convenience fee.",
      "But do they even give you the option of buying a paper ticket at the box office? I know a lot of theaters around here don't; the only way you can buy tickets is online or at the kiosks where the box office used to be... and then they just connect to the same website and tack on a convenience fee to that too. Bitch; I am AT the movie theater!!! What convenience?",
      "They'll direct you to a kiosk at the theater that will also have a fee attached, because there's one kid running the entire theater who's too busy at the concession stand to sell a ticket.",
      "Yep. A family of 4 is over $100 anytime we’d go. I’d prefer to order pizzas and pay $20 to stream a newer release in my home.  This is why we go maybe 1-2 times a year.",

Pays for itself with how often I go to the movies but that's because once again, it's just me a single dude.\n\nI just can't even fathom how going to the movie with a family is feasible for most people these days. The tickets alone add the fuck up, and let's be real if you have kids they're gonna want snacks.\n\nYou can always sneak in snacks but still, when you have kids they want that popcorn and soda. \n\nAnd then you add in the time of the movie, the travel with the family, and ads/previews are like 25 mins extra so have fun keeping the kids chill during that wait.",

They said that the reason prices are so expensive is due to the production companies charging out the wahzoo to lease the movies for the theaters. They went on to say that the reason concession prices are so high is because that’s where the theater makes its money - NOT ticket prices. \n\nSo Hollywood is basically shooting themselves in the foot, especially if they want to get people back in the movie theaters. People aren’t going to spend $40-$60 on a movie they aren’t *truly* excited to see. Even then, I know too many people (*myself included*) who wouldn’t shell out that money, even if they did really want to see it. They’ll just wait until it’s much cheaper.\n\nHollywood thinks people want to sit on their couch and watch movies, but people don’t want to spend money at the movie theaters when money is tight enough already",

Every time I go to the theater before we even get previews we get 5-10 minutes of straight ads after spending $15-30 on a ticket.

Life free or die. It's a message we need now more than ever. Never stop being who you are. ",

There’s another layer to it with how he’s initially pursued by Native Americans attempting to stop him (as a vampire), and sheltered by members of the KKK.\n\nIt’s so freaking good to see Coogler doing original films again instead of corporate IP projects.

      "Y’all, I’m not gonna bury the lede here. Sinners is a 10/10, it’s the best thing I’ve seen in a long while. It’s everything I want in a movie. It’s super badass, it’s sexy, it’s funny, it’s mystical, it makes wild choices, it pulls no punches, it’s a period piece, a musical, a horror film, a social commentary. It never stops being the most insane and awesome vampire movie while the themes run deep through every scene. This is exactly the kind of best case scenario for Coogler who has spent the last decade plus making big studio IP films to kick down the doors and remind us he doesn’t need any of that to make a great fucking movie. \n\nThere is a sequence in this movie that had me levitating out of my seat with tears down my face, and I struggle between not spoiling it here but wanting to discuss it in depth. But I do want to talk about what this movie is getting at, because it’s such a brilliantly nuanced conversation taking place in a legit vampire movie and neither ever feel forced together. On the surface it might be easy to compare this to a Peele film or say it’s all about race, but really it’s just as much about culture. This movie is about why creating space for furthering the culture through art is important. The sequence I’m referring to is a little abstract and it’s the first time this movie’s thesis really opens up, but it’s so incredible. Musically and visually and thematically it’s an absolute home run and feels like Coogler showing off what he’s had up his sleeve all this time. And the horror of this movie begins with the end of that sequence, when you see the three vampires watching these people have a great time and while it’s not stated out loud, the visual message here is that these boring cultural vampires cannot stand not being invited to join the party. And that’s about to ruin everyone’s night. \n\nI honestly feel like this movie does such a fantastic job of conveying its theme that I will do it a disservice here, but I’m going to try. The lore of this movie is that some people are so fucking good at making music that they awaken evil spirits to challenge them, which is already cool as hell. Sammie is the one the vampires want the most. Why? Because he’s culturally significant. The vampires want him to become one of their collective consciousness, sharing his music and talents with the monoculture. But these people that have worked so hard to carve out a space for themselves know Sammie is meant to enrich their specific culture, that’s why they're so protective of him and why Smoke basically threatens him to stay. It’s not about keeping anyone out, it’s about how when there’s plenty of places to go enjoy folk music or the mainstream, there should be no problem with there also being a space for the minority culture to thrive. \n\nAnd how about these vampires? This movie is hilarious as much as it is frightening, and the vampires being Irish sea shanty folk singers is maybe the funniest thing about it. I didn’t take it as a knock on any specific culture, but folk music like that is so dependent on synchronization and unity while the cultures being explored in that club music scene feels much more based in individuality and unexpected flavor. It’s so genius to make that the collective consciousness style and how their ultimate goal is to consume other cultural art to be one with their mainstream ideals. It actually works so well with the old lore of vampires, for example them needing to be invited in is so perfectly indicative of how personal it feels to not be invited into these spaces even if it’s for the purpose of preservation of the art. I love folk music, but what a great director does is show you their perspective and I can feel how Coogler feels when he hears it with this movie. \n\nAnd the cherry on top of this insane movie is how religion plays into it all. I think this is a little more buried in the text, but it is called Sinners and opens with a church so it was on my mind. In the climax when Sammie defaults to the Lord’s Prayer and the vampire starts reciting it too, something really clicked for me. Something about how organized religion is the original monoculture, forced upon people and now so deeply rooted that separating it from current culture is almost impossible. Sammie isn’t just fighting the idea of mainstream music and people trying to bite his lived-in style, he’s fighting his father who has religious expectations and sees his creativity as an obstacle stopping Sammie from being Godly. It’s a brilliant opening because of the vibe of that first scene, seeing Sammie go back home, my immediate thought was “oh look what the nightlife did to this boy” and after seeing the movie you know how important that night of playing was to him, how it wasn’t the club that destroyed him. \n\nThis movie committing to the ending, having him clutch that guitar neck and drive away, it’s so powerful. The best thing we can do in this world is be true to our creativity, and this movie is all about that idea. Not to mention the loving eye this movie puts on the brief period where the brothers owned their own profitable business and gave their people a safe space to celebrate their culture, that really got to me. I believe the title, Sinners, refers to the creatives who reject any sort of monoculture and truly seek the unique, the art that could only come from them and their background, and it’s so brilliant because that’s what this movie is. Fully unique and only possible through the lens of the creative force behind it. Coogler is Iron Chef level cooking with this, arguing that being an artist/sinner is better than being a boring saint. \n\nThematic poetic waxing aside, this movie just absolutely fucks. It’s so sexy and entertaining, I couldn’t take my eyes off it. It has some WILD dialogue but these actors sell the hell out of it, especially Hailee who has a really tough role with some insanely explicit lines that she sells so well. And with all these amazing and lived-in characters, this movie is not precious about keeping them alive or from turning. The build-up to the vamps getting invited in was so damn good, I was in tears when the shopkeeper screamed it out. And that shot of everyone grabbing weapons while the vampires  open that giant barn door, I swear you could have punched me in the fucking face and I wouldn’t have stopped watching. The swiftness with which that scene devolves into just death and massacre and violence is what a good climax is all about. Even if you’re not paying attention to the themes, this is a fully satisfying vampire horror extravaganza. \n\nI’m going to wrap this up, but I need to highlight how rare it is to really earn an ending like Michael B. Jordan mowing down racists. Like, it’s such a tropey blaxploitation revenge moment, but it feels amazing with those guitar riffs and with everything leading up. In maybe this movie's most brilliant turn, the vampires aren’t even the most evil characters. At least they offer some semblance of a life, and I really don’t think this movie damns the vampires fully as much as sees them as a naturally occurring obstacle to overcome in order to keep cultural identity unique. No, the real villains of this movie are the Klan racists, and it can be argued that the most convincing argument the vampires make for assimilation is how the racists were going to kill everyone anyways. Why not join mainstream culture and go on to turn the racists into vamps as well? So it feels earned and oh so right when the racists show up for the final scene and get what’s coming from an angry Jordan who had lost everything except his guns.\n\nThis movie rocks but the ending plus the mid-credits scene blast this off into undeniably incredible territory. It sees the vampires with such empathy, in a way, and there’s real literary value in how the only survivors of the night are the artist and the entrepreneur, and how Smoke had to overpower his vamp brother in order to get them to leave Sammie alone. This is a movie that will be talked about and thought about for years and years, and I for one can’t wait to rewatch it a million times. Like I said, 10/10.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner",

      "Pretty much. Given how fast movies hit streaming nowadays and how convenient it is. Going to the movies is now seen as just paying a premium price to see it a movie as soon as possible so if people aren’t really that interested in a movie, they’ll just decide to wait.",
      "It's because the GA has been conditioned to pay $10/month for Netflix and watch literally endless hours of content. There is virtually no risk. Hate the movie you chose after 20 minutes? Watch something else!\n\nGoing to a movie -at a minimum - is going to cost you $10-$12/ticket. A standard date night at the movie after tickets, snacks, and drinks is probably close to (if not more than) $75. And that's a lot of money to lose on something you end up not liking. And that's going to be on Netflix in 2 months anyway. \n\nIt's not necessarily the quality of the movies; it's the prices. The days of audiences rolling the dice on a $12 movie ticket are over - and they aren't coming back.",

      "That’s overlooking that John Wick’s box office return was successful. Much easier to convince studios when you prove you can bring money in.",
      "Would it be a better model to release an original IP through streaming first, see if it sticks, then release the sequels to theater?",
      "no, it's the opposite -- the initial theatrical release is advertisement for the movie on streaming. the model is to plan for the movie to make back some portion of its investment in theaters, but actually aim it towards success on streaming. you're leaving money and word-of-mouth on the table if you just fully skip the theatrical window.",
      "Anyone with half a brain is able to recognize the \"just make good x\" logic is a deeply flawed thought terminating cliche. \"Good\" things bomb all the time, while \"bad\" things are popular instead.

I ain't referring to that trailer as \"fantastic\" in any way.",

Coppola sold his winery to fund Megalopolis - damned shame, since his wine was far better than the movie. \n\n\n\nAll three flopped. With 2 out of the three on the list of biggest flops of all time. Hell, I genuinely think Megalopolis and Better Man might be the #1 and #2 flops on the all time flops list. \n\n  \nOf the two quasi-originals, Fall Guy flopped really bad. Argylle also flopped at the box office, but at least Apple TV funded production.",

      "I think it’s more compelling to exclude adaptations. I don’t think people think of book adaptations as being unoriginal. By that logic The Godfather, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Apocalypse Now are just recycled unoriginal movies.",

      "If even big franchise films aren't safe, imagine original films. These are different times.",
      "Everyone keeps talking about the streaming window and that might be a part of it but I think “general appeal” is the major reason why some of these movies fail. Even when we had 90 day windows, there were plenty of movies that bombed financially. Sure, maybe if Companion was exclusively in theaters for the 90 days window, it might squeeze out a few million more but I don’t think you would see that much of a difference. I don’t think the 90 day window is the magical solution that everyone here thinks it is.",
      "Yes, this is the problem. Unfortunately, it's not simply a matter of \"make good movies\". If a movie doesn't feel like an event, people generally don't go anymore. Part of it is the short theatrical window and movies being available on streaming within 2 months or so. \n\nPeople are saying \"but audiences don't like those movies as much as critics\", but in the cases of the movies you mentioned, the audience scores are still good or very good. They might be lower than critics' scores but not by much. Like Mickey 17 is 78/73 and Companion is 95/89. The only one that is significantly different is Black Bag, and even then the 71% from audiences isn't terrible (although for an audience score, yes, that is low).\n\nEvery movie can't be a stone-cold classic. If the solution is to put out an absolute masterpiece that appeals to critics and audiences almost every week, then it's doomed. That's never been the case. Movies like Black Bag and Novocaine used to do perfectly well, even if audiences didn't fall in love with them.\n\nThe problem is what do we do? If studios just give up (which would be understandable) and just not put out mid-budget and original movies like these, then that's all there is to it. But is there a way to come back from this? To get people to go see movies like this, even if not in droves, enough that they at least are minor successes? \n\nWould lengthening theatrical windows and releasing more films in theaters and making straight-to-streaming movies rare do enough? If not, what else is the solution? Because clearly just \"put out good movies\" isn't the answer.",
      "I think it’s cost , my local theater does $5 movies on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday morning. The theater is always slammed then. I end up going on normal price days because the crowds and teens are too much. But it proves there is interest at a reasonable price.",
      "There's a reason that's a special thing, though. They can't function if that's the price all the time. There have always been cheap prices for matinees and such. Right now, Tuesdays do well because of this, but still it only means doubling a normal day. \n\n$5 isn't a reasonable price. Average ticket price of $11.31 is perfectly reasonable. But as you say, even the $5 isn't worth it for you, because you'll pay more to avoid the crowds.",

What's the difference between Michael Fassbender in The Killer (2023) on Netflix, and Michael Fassbender in Black Bag (2025) in the movie theaters?\n\nI don't think the average movie fan is going to go to the theater for what they perceive as a \"TV\" movie. Streaming has changed the perception of what movies should look like. \n\nI think movie fans know streaming movies are mid to poor quality, but are Hollywood movies better. To the movie enthusiast, yes they are, but to the casual fan, probably not.\n\nHollywood has to do a better job of differentiating their theater movies from at home streaming movies.",

      "I liked it a lot. I think it's Steven Soderbergh's attempt to make a John Le Carre George Smiley movie. If you like a movie like Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy then you'll like Black Bag.",
      "This is a great way to phrase it and what hollywood has successfully done very well in previous eras of strife (invention of television, invention of home video, invention of video games, the internet, etc). The narratives about tv being a lower form of art, not being a place for movie stars or \"real directors\" was all driven by the movie industry. They wanted you to think these two things were completely different, and how could you ever really compare them. It's interesting to go back and read about this era. Hollywood participated in a crazy targeted campaign to fight TV tooth and nail. As a result...two industries! Then later the studios bought the networks and the telecommunications companies bought the studios, but that's getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nThe movie industry had previously gone out of their way to separate film and keep it special rather than letting the more convenient industry take over their product. I'd say the biggest difference here is that because every studio tried to start its own streaming service, it was marketing to YOU the consumer that you could get the same experience at home that you could get in theaters. The same company that was trying to get you to the cinema was also trying to get you to stay home. They needed to justify their gigantic spend for streaming, so they sold that to audiences and stopped selling something special on the big screen. Max goes Day in Date. Lucasfilm frequently sold Mandalorian as \"Star Wars movie quality every week.\" 20th Century releases movies like Prey direct to Hulu. They were trying to shift the industry, consciously, to streaming. It wasn't just that audiences CHOSE streaming. The studios SOLD streaming.\n\nWell...\n\n...it's bit them in the ass now because their streaming services are all colossally failing and they've devalued the only reliable money maker they had left - the theater. I also think Hollywood really underestimated how bad of a product a single MOVIE is in the digital marketplace. Like if you think about it as a product, the internet is the last place you should sell it. It requires effort and attention to engage with it. A very rewarding product in the theater or as the singular movie you and your family have spent money to rent for the evening. That system rewarded what the product was and kept it special. As one of a million option tiles that pop up on a streaming service…less appealing. \n\nThe system could've worked. Netflix licenses the studio’s product and two industries emerge: Theatrical and Digital Streaming Distributors (like netflix) with a studio mandated PVOD window to duplicate the second run market of DVDs. Streaming becomes the new TNT/HBO syndication of movies, and everything else is Blockbuster online. \n\nInstead they tried to compete with Netflix as a studio on Netflix's home turf. They lost!",
      "The studios killed cinema when they shortened the release window. It’s just a slow death.\n\nWhat they’re going to find out later is they killed studios too, but that’s going to take longer.",
      "I agree the studios should experiment with lengthening the release windows again, but I say \"experiment\" because I'm far from 100% confident that it's going to work. It very well could end up that the streamers just take advantage of that gap and program top movies and series in the gaps to keep people at home. In other words, there's no guarantee that people who are willing to wait a few weeks won't also be willing to wait a few months, especially if they have good shit to watch at home in the meantime.",
      "I would love for them to try it, but I fear the genie is out of the bottle and it’s not going back in. Audiences have been trained too well now, and the streamers are pumping out so much content there’s no huge, organic demand for new movies.",
      "I agree, was going to see Mickey 17 then find out it is streaming in two weeks. Tough to spend so much money when I can watch it at home in a short while. Also saw Black Bag this weekend, great movie, and why can’t theatres have tiered pricing for smaller movies being less costly to get traffic in the building and have higher pricing for blockbuster movies. This one solution fits all just isn’t working.",
      "Theaters have tiered pricing based on showtimes (matinee vs primetime), it feels like a really sticky situation to pick and choose what should be higher priced or not. They already sort of do that by the fact that blockbusters and bigger films are released in imax and Dolby formats which are pricier.",
      "&gt; and why can’t theatres have tiered pricing for smaller movies being less costly to get traffic in the building and have higher pricing for blockbuster movies. This one solution fits all just isn’t working.\n\nParamount tried this for “80 for Brady” to convince the older audience to show up and it barely worked. Also, AMC did attempt to do tier pricing and that resulted in immediate heavy backlash so I don’t think theaters are going to try that again anytime soon. I know some would probably love to do that, but nobody wants to be the tone deaf idiot in the mist of “it’s already too expensive to go to the movies anyways” era.",
      "You mentioned movies that did not bombed though. Companion, Heart Eyes and Presence were low budget productions that did pulled a multiplier, and Novocaine just released with 75% of the worldwide market yet to open,it will probably break even.\n\nYou for sure did not expected any of these to perform like a $200M+ Marvel movie?",
      "Also Feb and early March releases which typically aren't the top tier releases of the year, and aren't marketed that way.  It's also a time of the year that typically has lower theater attendance in general.",

I also don't think its fair to say Black Bag is bombing, it'll make some money in theaters and make the rest on PVOD.\n\nBut you only go to theaters for big event films because prices are just too damn high, and they only make big event films out of existing IP.\n\nSo either theaters are going to adjust to being places where you see big event movies, while everything else goes to goes to streaming.\n\nOr they have to bring prices down and start making mid budget movies that don't need to pull a billion dollars to break even.\n\nBut stop blaming us, we don't get a vote in what they choose to do.",
      "The thing is that studios put less money into original films because it’s higher risk, which means both lower production budgets and lower P&amp;A budgets, which means people are less aware of them compared to blockbusters/franchises, which means they rarely break out or do much better than even, which means they’re riskier propositions, which means studios put less money into them etc etc. \n\nIt’s a bit self-fulfilling, really.",

Fall Guy last year was exactly what you reference here. It was liked by critics and audiences. It had recognizable stars and was essentially a higher quality Fast and Furious or Bourne. And yet it still flopped. It didn't even have a huge budget. For that kind of movie $125m is decent. With its box office, it would have to have cost $75m just to break even, which isn't realistic. \n\nAnd if the response is \"well, people just want easy-to-digest stuff\", that's still problematic. That wasn't always the case. movies with more to them than Fast and Furious used to do well too.",

Film is not an art for them, it is *only* entertainment. It sounds like condescension, but most people will even say, if you ask them, “I just go to the movies to shut my brain off for two hours.”\n\nAnd I kind of understand them, in the sense that if Disney had not ruined Star Wars, for example, I’d theoretically spend my entire years movie going budget to see nothing but Star Wars films, assuming there was sufficient output to do so.",

      "I think another aspect is there is a big disconnect between critics , the online audience and the general audience as to what constitutes a good movie. The people who log in to RT and give scores aren’t really the general public. The online contingent is a small sector of society. Cinephiles are at war with Marvel as if they are the ones making decisions for the audience. Even as Marvel’s veiw ship has declined it has not brought any interest to movie’s  people online consider worthy. The superiority complex of film twitter really won’t solve the underlying problem no matter how low they dunk on Marvel etc. At the end of the day as bad as they believe these movies are that is just what interests the average movie going audience."

      "I think for this film some things didn’t serve the plot they served the movie’s overall purpose/underlying meaning or teachings, which extends beyond the plot. From researching and watching I think the Asian couple were in the film for a purpose, apparently Ryan Cooger did his research about the south at the time of the film’s setting. From what I’ve looked up Chinese Americans owned and operated stores in the Jim Crow South and did business with Blacks. I think they were included to show a broader view of the people living in the Jim Crow south. You’ll notice there was even a Delta Chinese consultant, Dolly Li who worked on the film and was included in the credits.\n\nAs for the two men who were shot outside of the store I think it was pure comedy (the commentary during and immediately after the shooting garnered laughs in the theater and from me) and to show that the twins were really “about the life”.\n\nEdit: also there is a very old superstition in China and Korea that writing someone’s name in red is is associated with death or end of life so in theory the Asian couple actually does add to the plot also.",
      "Some people laughed at the guy getting shot in the knee when I saw it too.  It didn't come off that way to me.  It seemed pointless and cruel.",
      "Yep. It was to show his cruelty. Or at least the exterior cruelty because he has a softer side when he walks away.",
      "Respectfully if you didn’t understand the purpose of the Asian family you’re just an idiot lmao",
      "I like how their comment was basically \"No one's saying the movie needs to explain more, but I want it all explained to me in detail because I can't connect the dots myself\". Like they in one comment completely don't get so many parts of the movie and yet claim it doesn't need to be made clearer to them. \n\nI personally love that the movie trusts you to understand all of this stuff. Most of their \"complaints\" are very obvious character building or setting choices. And like you said, if you don't already get things like why there's an Asian family included from the movie itself, then you're just missing the point.",
      "Based on the responses of people pointing out the historical connections it just seems like you were too lazy to do the absolute bare minimum to dig into whether there was some connection. Perhaps try google next time.",
      "You are very confidently wrong.\n\nStack shooting those robbers were to set up how cold blooded he is, also the reaction the robbers had to smoke set up how well known and feared the twins are. \n\nThe “Asian” couple goes back to Delta Jim Crowe days, the Chinese community were often lumped in with black folks in that area and were often the owners of the town shops that would gladly allow black folks to shop. \n\nSounds like the LEGO movie may be more your speed",
      "I think you’re too worried about the plot, some movies are intentionally light on plot so they can focus more on the characters themselves, which is the case with Sinners. It’s better to consider this as more of a character study of the twins and Sammie, as well a look at the influence of the blues on black culture.\n\nAs for your complaint about it being “cliched” that the vampires were a bunch of evil white people, that’s the thematic crux of the movie. On the surface, Sinners is a movie about vampires. But metaphorically, it’s about cultural appropriation and assimilation.\n\nThe vampires force their mainly black victims to become one with them, which isn’t entirely dissimilar to what happened to black people when they interacted with white people in the past (and in the present). The vampires seem to be enthralled by Black culture and music, but they still effectively kill most of them just so they can have them under their thumb and take advantage of the things they like about them. Sound familiar?\n\n[This](https://piakan.medium.com/sinners-a-blood-soaked-tale-of-the-blues-2c15ed6e9e4c) is a pretty good article about the movie’s thematic purpose.",
      "Ok fair take. Thank you for sharing. It helps",
      "“too worried about the plot” in a movie lmfao. \n\nif the symbolism is more important than the story you have failed to make a movie. like “us”.",
      "With respect, this is the kind of thinking that has led cinema astray in some ways. While it’s obvious what Coogler was doing with his film, and yea extremely impressive and all that, it regardless was not a great final product. In my mind, pacing is important, tying the story together is important, knowing when to edit things down is important.  A film cannot stand on its metaphors and meaning alone.\n\nI think the film would’ve worked better as a hang out movie sans vampires. It otherwise felt like a cop out; tacked on, even. Maybe audiences aren’t prepared to see regular ass, non-vampirical white people as the villain idk.",
      "Not that I think the films are similar but kinda reminds me of once upon a time in Hollywood. Every scene was great acting great good dialogue all that jazz but over all that movie seemed like a big collection of scenes with no real focus then of course the over the top ending when Leo came out with the flame thrower I genuinely thought to myself self is this a dream sequence? Was all just to much. How ever I’d sooner watch that again over sinners.",
      "Thank you, I'm a month late and these are my thoughts. It sort of feels like the film(and audience) is proud enough of itself to be satisfied merely referencing history. Yes, it's neat to see a movie show what the South was actually like, racial and economic diversity included. Yeah, it was neat that the villains were literal cultural vampires represented as, vaguely, the evils of whiteness personified. But it doesn't... Do anything with these themes. Its happy to tell us, \"See? I know this history. Did you catch that reference?\" \n\nFor reference, I'm a Poor White southerner by ancestry and my friend is a Black American with roots in the Caribbean. We both felt it was... A bit corny and boring. I was excited when the villain was a Poor White dude from Ireland, and I was even more excited when the first victim was the ostensibly white woman. Was she going to use her whiteness and insider status to invite the vampires in and this destroy community? No, she is going to fuck the protag and then kill him. Will the sharecropper watching the door be enticed to let the vampires in with promises of riches? No, he will be bit off camera in a funny way. Will native religions that are closer to the earth be shown to deter these evil spirits while Christianity is shown to be a corrupting force? Kind of, but we don't really go anywhere thematically with the idea of people losing their religion and land to Christianity and thus the villains thematic purpose becomes muddied.\n\nIt was as if the movie set up an excellent stage for social commentary and then decided the stage setting was enough.",
      "Can a black director ever make a movie without having to outrightly say \"fuck the white man\" though?? Like come on, there were fucking vampires and yet at the end the Klansmen were treated and offed in worse fashion, making the point even clearer. \n\nHad the movie not been so black-centric, it wouldn't be getting the praise it is, lets be entirely honest. Even critics have openly admitted the film has problems they're willingly ignoring but refuse to say why?",
      "it's a movie about black people back in the 30s IN THE SOUTH. It's very obvious who the villains of the movie are gonna be.",

      "Brother it’s a commentary about the predatory nature of big executive music labels. And all the cultures vultures alike. Remmicks whole mission is to capture Sammie and his musical talents. It’s also set in the 1930’s. The villains /have/ to be white. Maybe instead of feeling insecure you could have taken the time to learn from it.",
      "Yeaaaaa nah, im not insecure because an all over the place dogshit movie about cultured vampires, ghetto mob men, and the kkk wasn’t good bro",
      "If it’s about big music executives, why weren’t they Jewish?\n\nNot even a tongue in cheek question either, it’s one based on fact if that’s the type of manipulation being focused.",
      "Oh wow. I didn't see the underlaying theme of cultural appropriation. &gt;!Remmick was Irish, and the Irish back then were treated similarly, if not the same as black folks were. I came out of the movie thinking that he just wanted a family again, because racists are what tore his own apart, and he saw a common bond with Black southern men and women. He wanted to destroy the cultural divide through his vampirism, and at the same time bring the spirits of his Irish ancestors back through Sammie's music.!&lt;",
      "The fact that he’s Irish is part of the theme since it evokes a sense of irony of being part of being a part of people whose culture is washed away by a coloniser, only to do the same to other oppressed people",
      "I guess I felt like this movie felt unfocused from my perspective. I felt like everything up until the juke was character focused. \n\nWhereas I felt like once they got to the sawmill, the film became much more experiential and emotional. Enjoy the music. Enjoy the shots. \n\nBut when the vampires showed up, I felt like both of those aspects took a backseat. The climax in particular just kind of felt like they decided it was time for the movie to end. I didn’t feel like I really got endings to each  of the characters in a way that felt set up by the beginning of the film. \n\nI think any of those vibes would have made a good movie, I just didn’t understand why each of them existed together. They felt at tension with each other. \n\nI feel like the film also lacks tension because we know how it’s all going to end because it’s how the movie starts. The main character seems to be the only one to survive. So there’s little dramatic tension in who will/wont escape. \n\nThen you add in the showdown with the KKK, which didn’t feel especially well motivated from a character perspective. And then add on it the odd mid-credits sequence where the characters hug. It just kind of feels all over the place. The vampires don’t seem to be purely evil like they’d been implied to be. Maybe there’s some lesson or theme there, but I felt unaware of it. \n\nMostly I felt surprised  by the tonal and narrative disconnect between each stage of the movie. I just didn’t feel like it all came together.",
      "It's totally all over the place. Fully agree with this assessment. I thought it was very odd that they took such pains to cultivate historical realism for a certain time period (which I appreciated!) but then ruined the vibe by introducing entirely uncreative stock vampires. It made it a lot less compelling to me.",
      "Why do vampires need explaining? You already know what they are and what they’re about. ",
      "My guy... please explain to me how a vampire was running in golden hour while there was still sunlight out... explain to me how vampires are supposed to have super strength and agility which is shown when Stack broke the door, but somehow him and Smoke were evenly matched in the last fight... explain to me how the main vampire was in a body of water while the cousin was praying and it somehow didnt create holy water... explain to me how when you kill the main vampire, their offspring should die too but somehow Stack and the love interest were both still alive... And before you say that doesnt happen, when the main vampire was stabbed, all of the other vampires felt it and were frozen before the sun suddenly came out... which is enough to concur that this is the case.",
      "I feel like most of these are pretty straightforward no? The main vampire was getting burned as the sun went down and we can assume/imagine he was in the shade or something prior to find the racist cabin.\n\nThe super strength part is a legitimate point though imo. They aren’t too consistent with their strength and the vampires get nerfed as the movie goes on. Especially when they get through the doors and our surviving crew has a “Hold the Line” moment where realistically only Smoke could fight them but there were so many he should have been overrun. \n\nNo idea how the holy water works lol. I’m assuming the water didn’t become holy cause it didn’t meet all the requirements? Idk.\n\nI see the last point as if the main vampire gets injured they can all feel it but won’t actually die. Everyone except Mary and Stack burned because they were in the sun, but Mary and Stack were shown to leave earlier alluding to they made it out before the sun came up. \n\nJust my thoughts, there are some inconsistencies yes but overall if you don’t focus on that I thought it was a great movie.",
      "I appreciate your response, but, yeah see, that’s kind of the problem. You said most of those points were \"straightforward,\" but then couldn’t actually explain them with anything solid. Saying “we can assume” or “maybe this” or “I’m guessing that” isn’t the same as giving an actual explanation. That’s exactly what I was getting at, the movie makes up its own lore, breaks it, and never gives us anything to work with. If it really was that straightforward, there shouldn’t be this many “idks” in your explanation.\n\nAlso, just to respond to some of your comments, why did the main vampire instantly disintegrate when the sun came up, but not when he was first introduced in full sunlight? That wasn’t shade, he was standing in a full beam of light. And as far as I know, saying a prayer over a body of water is literally what makes it holy water, so that moment made no sense either.\n\nAnd, if all the vampires can feel the pain of the main one, it strongly implies they’re connected which is why, in most vampire lore, killing the master kills the offspring. That’s what made that whole sequence feel like it was setting that up... but then Stack and the love interest just walk away fine? If it didnt work that way then why add it to the film, twice - when he was hit by the guitar and the stake through the heart.\n\nAlso, you’re saying we shouldn’t focus on the inconsistencies, but the inconsistencies are part of the movie. That stuff matters, especially when the film leans on vampire lore to drive the plot. People keep overlooking how trash the movie was and focus on the cultural aspect of the film rather than the entire thing, which is why they rate it a 10. Its actually pretty wild.",
      "Vampire lore is so far from a monolith your entire criticism crumbles if you accept and acknowledge that fact. Brian lumley's vampires for example, are extradimensional leeches that morph the biology of their host. They are capable of producing offspring because they sre not your typical undead. They are completely immune to all the silly religious symbols that The lost boys vampires would be killed by. Twilight has vampires that sparkle. The majority of your criticism is, \"these vampires don't adhere to my definition of vampires\" and to that I can only say there is a lot out there that won't my friend.",
      "That's ok.\n\nIt is indeed a fucking excellent film. No need to attempt to explain b/c your mind is made up. Kinda like politics. I ain't gonna change your mind about anything.",
      "I wasn't asking for that.",
      "&gt;I wasn't asking for that.\n\nOh?\n\n&gt;I would like to know what people enjoyed about the movie",
      "You didn’t explain what you enjoyed, you just condescended to OP",
      "Sounds like you need to focus on your own reading comprehension. How's that for condescension? Hey I'm a poet and didn't know it!",
      "I also thought it was an overhyped movie that started very slow and the vampires seemed secondary to a story about two brothers who came back home to the south after going to Chicago. ",
      "It wasn’t an excellent film. The plot was weak. Plot was as rushed to its climax with an unrealistic character action (Asian lady could’ve literally waited 20 minutes to fight sun-weakened vamps), a lot of untied or unrelated context, weak character build that could’ve been done instead of the brothers going around getting people to come to the juke joint. This was not an excellent movie. Watch this again in 5 years without all the hype and see if you feel the same way",
      "I agree, there was not point in this movie. To felt like a waste of time.",
      "Very late to the discussion. For context, I’m a black woman who went into the movie expecting it to be amazing because it’s been hyped to be amazing. I love period pieces, I love movies that explore race, and I love horror—it’s my favorite genre. \n\nI was really confused about how and why this movie got the hype it did. It was entertaining, but as you said, the plot was incredibly weak. Way too much time was spent on them running around getting stuff for the event that night. Way too much complexity was added in places where it wasn’t necessary. \n\nFor example, Mary. Very rich potential there—a woman who lives as a white woman while openly having black ancestry and associating with black people. How did she get there? That would be an unusual life at that time—plenty of people “passed” as white, but they did so secretly and did not associate with black people to avoid blowing their cover, since “passing” was a serious offense with deadly consequences (read The Vanishing Half, a great novel on the topic). So how is Mary married to a white man, passing between white and black spaces, openly associating with black people and having a past sexual relationship with a black man? Yelling in the streets about their sex life? Those things weren’t acceptable then and we are given zero backstory as to how Mary is managing this double life.\n\nAnd then there’s Sammie’s music. This supernatural music is super cool and they touch on it in the beginning, then bring it back and explain it more fully right before the conflict with the vampires begin, and then…. That’s it! That’s the last of Sammie’s magical music. I thought the music was going to be more important to the story and was extremely confused when nothing really played out with that (eg Sammie using his music to overcome the vampires). \n\nInstead of showing the twins running around preparing for the party, they should have fleshed out Sammie’s abilities more, or more clearly explained where the vampires came from and why they wanted Sammie. Or if the twins were the focus, make them the focus and have it be about their battle with the vampires without the extra unnecessary, mystical details about other characters",
      "It's shit and it shows more how audiences are getting dumber and have brain rot. \n\nThe film set up 20 things that led no where. Had a stupid ass villain that lived for thousands of years and for some reason was to busy doing a fucking jig to know when the sun was rising and not only that it's not like he was distracted doing the dumbass jig, he was the leader of it. \n\nEverything was dumb as hell. \n\nHe immediately blows up as soon as the sun rises but only gets a few burns when the natives are hunting him? Dumb. \n\nAnd that would've been a cool plot point the natives. But nah. The ride away never to be seen again. Dumb. \n\nThe with stuff would've been cool af but nope get none of that besides a breastfeeding scene and a ridiculously awkward and stupid cabin fuck. \n\nMichael B Jordan is an atrocious actor. Soft boy wannabe hard. \n\nThis movie did one thing for me tho. Made me realize people thing they're a lot smarter than they really are. \n\n\nExcellent? You're tripping, my man.",
      "Agreed. It is was pretty bad. My movie theater didn’t clap at the end. Ppl were laughing cuz it tried so hard to be deep and it wasn’t.  People were laughing at the end…lol. All this talk of Being an excellent film is hot garbage",
      "About 30% of the people in the theatre I was in clapped. I was actually surprised and I wasn’t sure what they were clapping for. I was already half way out the door because I couldn’t wait for it to end. Maybe they were  clapping because it finally came to an end?",
      "Seconded. It’s a film-loving film-maker making a real film for film-lovers. I felt like clapping at the end. RC is in a tight group of five or six film makers who adore the language of cinema and know how to pump film love straight into my soul. I saw it two days ago and am still thinking about it.",
      "I think you missed something really important about Remmick, the master vampire. He's specifically an Irish immigrant because of how Irish people were and now are treated in the United States.\n\nDuring the waves of Irish immigration into America, the Irish were treated pretty terribly. Quite a few articles from that time effectively call them 'white black people' but a lot less kindly. By the 1930s though when the movie took place, that sentiment was dying down and the descendants of the original Irish immigrants were assimilating into 'white American' culture. In the process, they lost quite a bit of their own. \n\nIf you've been to the northeast part of the US, there's still lots of Americans who consider themselves 'Irish' and would describe their culture as 'Irish'. But as someone who's lived both in New England and Ireland, what is presented as Irish culture in the US lacks the actual connections to Irish history by this point. They legitimately enjoy their practices, but they're not 'Irish practices' anymore. They've been assimilated into white society, and in that there's some indescribable soul that's been lost.\n\nNow back to Remmick, a man who's looking for a culture he remembers and has lost. He comes upon a group of people who remind him of his own, and a people he knows are going to be targeted and killed the next day. In his mind, he is saving them while regaining the community he lost. But when he turns the black people from the juke, they lose a part of themselves. They all function as one being, and are happy, but they've lost their ability to connect with their ancestors. The same way that the previous English and German immigrants assimilated the Irish, this Irish man is assimilating this community of black people. \n\nTo make it personal for a minute, I'm American with Irish and Pontic heritage and grew up mainly in New England. Lots of modern day people from that area have Irish ancestry and call themselves Irish-Americans, but hold different values than the Irish people I met while living in Ireland. And, they're kinda racist. I got a lot of shit growing up for having a 'strange' last name and not being pale as fuck. \n\nRemmick and his turning people is less a call against white people, and more a call against assimilation and color blindness. Communities are developed and maintained through celebrating who we are, where we've come from, and freely sharing that with others. Pushing everyone into 'sameness' in order to be unified is the threat that Remmick brings to the story.",
      "The movie didn’t expound upon that tho. I saw it too about his irish background and how he wasn’t accepted but the movie did a poor job of bringing that out. You could’ve mad remmick become an anti hero and at the end the black ppl and Irish vamps end up going against the kkk somehow.  But they didn’t. They just had him do an expository dance and that was it",
      "lmao the movie didn’t spell out every little thing for me so it was bad",
      "The movie was fairly explicit with these themes. Maybe you weren't paying attention, or have poor media literacy?",
      "this + a major theme of the movie is Sammies internal conflict between Christianity and Music as a source of salvation. Delta Slim and Remnick both mention how Christianity was something forced on the slaves and on the Irish that destroyed their heritage, while music is authentically theirs. In the climactic battle, prayer is unable to save Sammie- it takes his guitar and Smoke to both defeat the vampire. This reinforces his decision to become a bluesman because his music and family/heritage are more powerful than Christianity.\n\n\nYou can dig into this even further with the controversial and divisive legacy of the Catholic church in Ireland and the relevance of religion to The Troubles and the division between North Ireland/ Ireland",
      "This is actually really interesting and that went completely over my head while watching the film. It would have helped make the film a bit more engaging to watch.",
      "Yeah dude, I'd really recommend you take another watch when it comes out on streaming. There's a lot of little details that build the plot. It's very much what's called 'soft worldbuilding'; things are given in terms of references and unspoken details more than an in your face way of pushing the plot forward.\n\nA great example of this is when the twins buy the mill from the KKK dude at the beginning. One of them comments about the floors being freshly washed and asks the guy why they washed the floors. The KKK guy doesn't give a real answer of just spits some tobacco on the floor. But from the end of the movie you can get the idea that the mill was used by the local KKK to kill people in the past. It's never something said, but can be put together from tiny bits of dialogue and looks through the movie. It's why the mill is referred to as a slaughterhouse by multiple people.\n\nAnother tiny example is the Choctaw. There's a very specific reason he picked them besides that they lived in Mississippi and Alabama before being forcefully relocated to Oklahoma. During the Great Famine when the Irish were starved, the Choctaw sent a donation of about $5000 in today's money to the people of Ireland. The Choctaw had just barely survived the Trail of Tears themselves, and yet they gave everything they could to these people they had never met. To this day there's close connections between the Choctaw nation and Ireland. Kennick is the only person who refers to the people hunting him as Choctaw, by their name. The two racists he cons into letting him in just call them Indians. He shows them a level of respect that would not be common during this time period, even though they're trying to kill him.\n\nAnother bit I noticed is when Sammie, Stack, and Delta Slim are driving back and Slim is telling the story of a friend who got lynched over having too much money on him and trying to make a better life for himself. The amount his friend had was $12,000. In 2022 Coogler was briefly arrested at a bank for trying to withdraw $12,000 of his own money from his account, because the teller thought he was a robber.\n\nCoogler did some great historical research with this film. There's a lot of little details that help make the story that may not be noticed the first time. The only reason I know some of the history stuff myself is my father-in-law is a history buff who's part native. But overall, it's very much a story told in what isn't said or explained as much as what is.",
      "Not sure why some people seem to be so upset with you sharing your opinion on not liking it that much.\n\nI agree with you, went to see it because of all the hype and though it was average at best. What was not average and was superb was the acting, performances, and the quality of the film production. But overall, it felt quite boring, predictable and simple. The plot didn’t feel quite interesting and yes, I agree the whole white people vampire antagonists is also quite cliche. \n\nAlso didn’t love how the vampires are portrayed as super deadly and fast and strong, yet during the final barn scene even though the vampires outnumber them, the vampires don’t appear to be that strong. \n\nI appreciated the music scenes but they didn’t feel necessary to the movie as well. \n\nI’m not sure what the hype is about tbh. I recall being not disappointed but almost bored right after the movie, and there was another showing of Warfare by A24 right next door that I then went to go watch. And damn, watching the 2 movies side by side I think even exasperated how boring sinners was even more.\n\nRecommend warfare if you haven’t seen it already.",
      "I pretty much concur with you whole take. I'll definitely take it recommendation and watch that film!",
      "I also agree with you. I truly don’t understand the hype. Technical aspects? sure, very good, nicely crafted, with great DP and sound. I would say the acting is also very good.\n\nAnd that’s it. I couldn’t care about the story at any point, I was suppose to care about these characters considering what happens after and I couldn’t find myself caring. The story didn’t push a character narrative, it pushed more a painting narrative, a collective moment in a place: showing what it was like for these people in this time and region… but never made me really care about any of them. And then there is the supernatural aspect of it, I’m a massive fan of vampires (hey I even laughed and found the nod of the invite part cool, old True Blood style): taking into account this movie wasn’t about that exactly, I found the whole vampire aspect super shoehorned and sort of a waste potential… suddenly they show up, and come and gone as well as an afterthought. \n\nI see a ton of theories and reading too much into it,  and I wonder if I watched a completely different movie… or I simple don’t vibe with it and the rest of the people seemingly do.",
      "I don't understand the rave reviews either tbh...\n\nGood cinematography, great music, good vfx, good characters.\n\nWhere the movie stopped me from liking it was when something great was introduced, but then it didn't go anywhere.  To list my top few:\n\n\\- Like music transcending time... great idea, led to a great scene, but went nowhere.\n\n\\- Native Americans hunting down the vampire.  They were never heard or seen from again, not even after sunrise.\n\n\\- The inclusion of the ex-KKK, it had zero impact on the story.  In fact, it felt like the shootout was injected by a producer because they felt there wasn't enough action.\n\n\\- Most of the adults in an entire town were killed in one night... what was the fallout?  what happened to Grace &amp; Bo's daughter?\n\n\n\nBefore the end we were both just waiting for it to be over.  Which is unfortunate as I'd heard such get spoiler-free reviews and normally these types of movies (if done well) are very much my cup of tea.",
      "The KKK scene seemed like a forced and pointless Tarantino wannabe attempt. Trying to imitate Django Unchained.",
      "I feel like alot of the film was wanna be Tarantino but without the witty dialogue to back it up.",
      "Thats an excellent point and that is how i felt too",
      "Could not agree more… there was potential for so many solid storylines that could’ve conveyed the same messages but all of them went nowhere. Very confused leaving the theatre…",
      "The cinematography was great, not a bad performance from any of the actors, the music was incredible. The overall vibe of the film is off the charts. \n\nI don't need to know more about sawmill purchasing, the history of hoodoo, or vampire motivation. The first would've just dragged out an already pretty long movie, the second one can look into on my own time of an interest is sparked, and the third seemed obvious anyway. They're vampires, they want blood and to make more vampires. In this case they specifically seemed to seek out talented musicians. They don't need any more motivation, and I can't be bothered to care if the main villain is a white guy. \n\nThe only real complaint I can think of is that the native American apparent vampire hunters just fucked off and never showed up again, but I also can't really blame them. I just wanted to see more of them.",
      "I agree with you overall but I disagree that it’s even a little bit of a long movie. 2 hours and 15 minutes is like, exactly average for a non-animated film.\n\nEDIT: also, re: the vampire hunters: Yeah they left because it was night and so they needed to GTFO. I would have loved to see more tho",
      "The movie was a mess. Blues. Post-slavery. Chicago mafia. Irish dudes. Random asian couple. Twerking. Vampires. Random awkward sex scenes. Native American. Old man at the end. What the fuck is this a comedy, romance, horror, documentary. Pick a fucking genre. Half the people that think it was great wouldn’t have thought that if there wasn’t so much hype around it. The only good parts were the cinematography and the cast and all that requires is a fucking good budget. They got everyone to go watch it by throwing in big name actors (Micheal B) and inflating others (Ryan Coogler (a name most ppl never heard of until they mentioned him around this movie. Now everyone’s acting like he’s fuckin Christopher Nolan and that they’ve been known the guy. no hate to him though.) \n\nTo those who are going to respond with all the historical relevance and all the easter eggs my response is: I shouldn’t have to do/read a fucking history research project after watching a movie to understand it and enjoy it. The whole point of a fuckin movie is to SHOW it. I sat in the theatre for fuckin 2 hours like. You didn’t have time to dive just a little deeper into ONE of those topics? Ironically, the move Everything Everywhere All At Once was easier to follow.",
      "This is the most uncultured response I have ever seen lmfao. God forbid a movie expects you to come in with a smidge of world knowledge lol. Nobody knew the director of the blank panther and creed movies before this? I can’t even take this response seriously bruh lol the Minecraft movie seems like it may be more up to speed for you",
      "I have to disagree with you. It should not be required to enjoy the movie.",
      "The dialogue was unbearable and pretty much ruined everything for me",
      "My problem was huge parts of the dialog was just hard to understand with the dialect everyone was using.",
      "This was my issue with it as well. The dialogue made it genuinely unwatchable for me. It almost felt like a satire at times",
      "\"steal this pussy for a night\" like... What? I'm no prude but I found the occasional crass dialogue from Steinfelds character bizarre, especially for the period.",
      "It was basically From Dusk Til Dawn but with the plot tweaked to showcase themes on historic racism. Which is find. I commend the intent but as a horror movie fan, I didn't feel it was quite the revolutionary cinema experience as it's being perceived. It was okay at best.",
      "\"Agressively average\" is what my students would say",
      "Agree with you, man. It was a 6/10 at best. To be fair, I didn’t see the trailer to this movie. My friend just had an extra ticket, and I was hearing that this movie was 10/10. But man, that’s a stretch in the morning. \n\nActing was good, cinematography was great, but the PLOT was not clear up until the 2nd act. The first act dragged like a mf. The movie is advertised as Horror/Adventure. There was NO HORROR up until the last 30 minutes. The adventure ? I wasn’t quite interested in it because of how much it was dragging. Didn’t really feel like a journey, just a bunch of world building and side characters with hardly any payoff at the end. \n\nDon’t get me started on that dam “otherworldly connection” breakdance/twerk scene. I was cracking tf up when I saw that. Also, what the hell was up with MBJ getting it on with someone who looks like she could be his mom? Not a very attractive sex scene if u ask me but hey to each his own. \n\nThe film was just underwhelming. Definitely not a 98% or 10/10 rating that’s just absurd. The themes and cultural significance weren’t enough to keep me entertained. We criticize other movies when the plot doesn’t make much sense, the film drags on way too long before getting to the climax, &amp; when they don’t deliver on the genre’s they’re advertised to be (HORROR/ADVENTURE). Highest rated Horror film of all time My Ass. I’m holding it to the same standard as every other shitty movie i’ve seen.",
      "The movie is ok, but highly overrated. People will think I’m hating and I’ll get downvoted but I’m being 100% honest. It’s very very overrated",
      "I’ll watch it just cuz I love vampire films.",
      "Really wouldn’t even consider it a vampire movie. It was closer to a musical in my opinion. I get the message behind the movie but it just wasn’t a GREAT film to me",
      "I'm with you. I don't understand the hype behind this movie. Just watched it. The themes are there and message but the movie felt meh to me. It felt like it was trying too hard to be brilliant",
      "It was pretty good, a solid 7.",
      "It was one of the most fun things I have watched in Theaters in a long time. The music, themes, acting, visuals, some really wonderful moments. I just remember sitting in the theater and thinking, “now this is why you come to see a movie in theaters.”  I would have made a couple changes and maybe tried shortening it a bit, but would also love to see a directors cut at the same time. I’ll be rewatching sooner rather than later. \n\nI am sorry you missed out on this one. Maybe try rewatching it or watching someone dive into all the lore and themes. But not every movie will connect with everyone.",
      "My guess is you're trying to shoehorn this movies plot with the plots of other movies you're generally into, and because it didn't quite fit what you normally like you're saying you couldn't find the plot or it didn't make sense. The plot for any movie is pretty easy to make out. And you don't need to know the entirety of the plot before you see the actual movie. That spoils a lot of the surprise. The Irish vampire was not even an overly evil character, he was heavily implied to want to share eternal life and music with the main cast. \n\nThe Irish music numbers were actually really good, I think it was great music in those scenes as well\n\nThe KKK members were obviously bad. But they didn't stay racists when they became vampires, they were wholly different. Idk, I get that a lot of white characters were bad in this, but the movie is set in the south in a time where lots of white southerners were persecuting minorites. The bad white people were all depicted as being KKK affiliated. Do we want to ignore those kinds of people exist so that modern white audiences are more comfortable? Also Hailee Steinfeld was the hottie of the movie, and as a vampire she too was shown to be more interested in converting her friends than killing them. And she got to survive",
      "Something people aren’t talking about enough is the Indigenous community portrayed in this film. I took the presence of the Choctaw as a sentiment of “We tried to warn you” - as they were the first people (In what we now call the USA) to have their culture violently ripped from them. Them showing up at the door to look for Remmick was a genuine attempt at stopping that from happening again as the vicious cycle continues. I also love that they were included because Indigenous culture has so much folklore (Wendigo, Skinwalkers, etc), so in a way it seemed fitting that they were on the hunt for vampires.",
      "Oh I’m with you on this one",
      "I think saying that the vampires were \"just evil white people\" is doing it a massive disservice, tbh. Racism is the background of the movie, considering the setting, but I wouldn't consider it a theme at all the movie was looking to focus on.\n\n\n\n\nWhat I got out of it was more about how the oppressed can find their freedom and voice, their happiness and community. Because of the setting, that can LOOK a lot like a theme around racism, but the master vampire was from another very oppressed minority from America's history, and to me it seemed like the purpose for that was to show the parallel between the struggles his people(the irish) had faced, and the struggles the African American population faced in the south. To show that it isn't necessarily a race thing, and it isn't necessarily an \"us vs the oppressors\" thing, it's about how you keep ahold of your culture and how it is expressed while also trying to find a sense of safety and community.\n\n\n\n\nIt's absolutely fine if the movie wasn't for you(and I agree that the plot feels like the weakest part of the movie), but I really just don't love the argument that it's a \"Ope, classic White people vs Black people themes\" kind of movie.",
      "I’m going to be honest, I thought the vampire portions could’ve been more well executed. It made me laugh bc it was almost cheesy. We left before the movie was over.",
      "Ok, people probably don’t like your personality in real life. Does that make you overrated because people don’t get you? Or are you just not their type lol.",
      "I think it's weird that you started attacking my person.",
      "I couldn’t agree more, Sinners has got to be the most overhyped film in history. The characters are great and the setting is impressive but the actual unfolding of events is so unfocused. It’s like a hang out movie with vampires tacked on at the end. The beginning had me hooked but then about an hour in I was thinking when is something going to happen? There are tons of characters and conversations that flat out could’ve been cut completely and nothing would’ve changed. I don’t get it. It also has the unique distinction of being a small B movie affair with a huge budget. Complete dissonance. All that work on creating a period piece for a story so slight.",
      "I think too many movies suffer from really long run times due to unnecessary lore dumps. Sinners elected to expect you to get it as the story went along. There’s a broader message they’re telling beyond just vampires. \n\nI get if it’s not for you, but that doesn’t make it a bad movie either",
      "I kid you not I fell asleep through it like 5 times lol. I wish dancing vampires was all it took to keep me easily entertained😂",
      "I also could not make out what anyone was saying",
      "Crossroads meets Dusk till Dawn. But just a really boring, version of the 2 films. What a disappointment. Really don't know what all the fuss was about and why it got such high ratings. I'm glad someone got some enjoyment out of it. But me? Naaaaaah!!"

      "it pays off",
      "it damn well pays off",
      "I will say that I definitely felt the landscape around them was almost as much a character as the actors.",
      "Update:\n\n\n\nGive Blade to Coogler to write and direct, straight up.",
      "I just came home from watching Sinners and honestly i was really proud by what he chose to focus on. We didn't get slave porn, or trauma porn. \n\nWe got characters who a had agency, had great juicy roles from everyone. We got a post credit scene. We got a script with really good writing, afro surrealism, and a camera that worked hard to give exposition instead of just talking the audience to death with lore.\n\nIt was beautiful I think I may have cried twice. And it had alot of room to breath for a film that felt like it only really had one plot going on. It felt long despite being a short enough story with a strong buildup so that we love and see every character fleshed out.\n\nWe got a celebration of music and dance from several cultures, we were shown appreciation through participation. We had black people, African people, black American futures, asian people, indian people, and even white/european dancing and singing and pulling from all cultures.\n\nThis wasn't really a film about hate between races in fact I think this was more a film about unification despite differences, until the very end we were reminded that the only real enemies are the ones that commit genocide like the Klan.\n\nI think at the end of the day ignoring the beautiful spectacle it had great messages and the music was even better. It really smartly laid down their scoring to every dialogue so that there is a baseline of emotion throughout the entire script. You can hear the crowd lynching someone at the train station as he tells a story from memory. Another great exposition is without being told the location of their hometown we understand it's segregated without having to focus on segregation. We get one fantastic sequence of an Asian family who either works or owns two separate markets one for colored people and one for white people\n\nIt's been a long time since I've seen an amazing script in theaters, everything was well done.",
      "Also that scene of Delta Slim telling the story about Rice, with the whole \"flashback\" being played through audio. Perfect way to accentuate his storytelling",

      "If you think the movie is about Vampires you missed the whole point. The monsters could have been anything in this movie, zombies, the KKK, etc. You think vampires were a coincidence? The Vampires symbolize cultural appropriation. This is an accurate historical retelling of what happened with the Blues in America.  Life is hardest for blacks in Jim crow Mississippi, and as soon as they manage to set up shop serving their community with their culture (the blues) the vampires come to suck the life out of the community so they can thrive(record companies, Elvis, etc.). But first they have to be invited in. I love how truthful this movie is",

      "The invited in part was brilliant, making that such an essential part of the plot.",
      "So, I was thinking something along these lines the entire first half of the film...but where I got thrown off was when they focused in on the celtic turned..I dont know what to call it, hillbilly? Poor whites? culture, when all the vamps were dancing outside. The white vamps had their own thing going and were actually sharing it in some ways as well...like blues and bluegrass, etc were actually all from the same well. I was waiting the whole time for the white people to be the enemy to be conquered but when the head white vampire literally tipped them off to the plans of the Klan and it ended up being true, my thoughts on that shifted as well. I just saw the film last night and have been trying to reconcile what those points mean in relation to each other.",
      "Just watching this film, excuse the lateness. The head white vamp was Irish. At first I thought it was weird that the vamp wasn't British and representing colonialism, but then in the scene where he joins Sammie in reciting the Bible verse, I believe it was, he basically says a line that tells how his people were subjugated by the same oppressive hand (the church) and he came to know it was a comfort. The Irish have a similar history to many black cultures around the world in that they were also colonised by the crown. The start of the film ties African and Celtic culture together as having powerful art that traces back through time, or their own cultural narrative (specifically music history) that another culture wants to steal/exploit. These settled countries are perfect for these stories as the Irish were often shipped there (e.g. Australia) as criminals and suffered similarly poor treatment as the indigenous people. So the head Celtic having them all perform a jig was more representing his deep cultural ties to his people and trying to show the black people that assimilating into white culture and sharing their rich unique history was the way to immortality (vampires represent this), but really was \"selling the soul\" of black people, and the vampires were all those that had turned to the temptation offered by white cultural vampires, or had their hand forced. I loved the idea that music is storytelling art across time and that there were deep cultural roots for the different characters that the church was actually pulling them from. The church was flipped here, and was not salvation from evil, the vampires actually represented its end product, a shared cultural narrative to the exclusion of all others. Here the church is salvation forced upon a culture from the other that took it in the first place. It is the olive branch gifted from the same tree that collapsed onto their home",

Ryan actually went to the same college as I did like 8 years before me, and the Bay Area is close to me (I live in Sacramento), so that might have caused some bias. But I thought that his characterization of Oscar Grant was so three dimensional and realistic, a lot of movies that revolve around a tragedy like this do tend to sugar coat the person and I just think he did a really good job of being honest about Oscar's legal issues and his struggles, and it wasn't just a tragic story, it was also a celebration of the life of this young guy. Really really good movie.",

      "The Lord's Prayer not working was an important moment. \n\nThat was when it became clear - religion isn't a savior. It's just another way to bind people. The film was a series of people enthralled by the stuff that kept them from true freedom.",
      "The scene where Remmick recites the Lord’s Prayer with Sammie reinforces this take. \n\nRemmick tells Sammie that the men who took his father’s land brought the Lord’s Prayer with them, which is a reference to the Christianization of Ireland. Irish-Gaelic culture was assimilated to fit into Christian faith, with their history, lore and gods being twisted to fit with church doctrine. So while it was preserved in a sense, it would never be what it once was. \n\nRemmick is also an agent of assimilation; he can’t add to culture or create it, he can preserve it in a sense thru the memories of his victims but is cut off from participation. The Irish Jig he does, great as it was, resembles more a robotic imitation of a human dance with how perfectly choreographed it was, in contrast to the more vibrant, messy music and dance in the hall. He craves culture and community but can only create more hungry thralls like himself. \n\nThis might also play into Sammie’s choice to leave his father’s church at the end. He could have chosen the safety of his father and life as a preacher, rejecting music. But instead I think part of him saw he would just be assimilating into another unchanging collective instead of living. So he rejected that and chose to strike out on his own.",
      "Was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of Sinners on a full fledged IMAX screen this week. This movie is as good, as substantive, as cinematic as the early reviews suggest. The film somehow manages to infuse the vampire movie framework with layers you don't typically get from it (joy, musicality, reverie) alongside layers you absolutely expect from it (thrill, sorrow, tension). It's a got a sequence in the mid-2nd-act that I'm still thinking about two days later. Is the writing a bit overloaded and jumbled in spots? Yes. But even these flaws are counter balanced with a palpable passion and thoughtfulness too rarely seen in this scale of filmmaking. I haven't even really touched on the movie from a technical and craft perspective yet. Suffice to say, every department is working at the top of their games. The IMAX 65mm and Ultra Panavision 70 cinematography is stunning. Really, really, recommend people see this movie in the theaters, in IMAX, if possible.

      "The kind of film where you know the movie gods were right beside them as they were making it.\n\nRyan Coogler's films deal with the struggle of identity within a system trying to suppress you. Whether it's Oscar Grant trying to become a better version of himself in Fruitvale Station, Adonis Creed wrestling with his father’s legacy to create an identity of his own, or King T'Challa struggling with his role as a king—balancing tradition and duty with the need to make reparations for the past and forge a new path forward.\nUltimately, Coogler's films are about what it means to live as a person in a world that won’t let you—and how power, history, and love collide in that pursuit. Sinners, in that regard, might be his biggest and best culmination of that yet.\n\nSet in Jim Crow–era Mississippi, it’s about two brothers returning home and trying to start over, only to be confronted by an even bigger evil—the supernatural kind.\n\nSinners, while it will be marketed as a Michael B. Jordan movie, is really the story of a young kid named Sammie (played brilliantly by debutant Miles Caton). It’s through Sammie and his music that we become part of this world. His blues isn’t a form of entertainment—it’s a form of self-expression and spiritual awakening that pushes back against those who seek to exploit him.\n\nThe film sheds light on how Black art—especially music—is co-opted, commodified, and stripped of its cultural roots for white profit and pleasure. Through Sammie’s music, we hear echoes of resilience, sorrow, and survival. His music becomes an archive of history, and through it, he manages to create an identity of his own.",

They are approached by the monster of assimilation, which offers to free them from the bad of their other-dness if they also give up the good of their identity. Remmick is Irish because the Irish used to be likewise excluded, but in America they crossed over. In the end the old man says that the day he spent revelling in his culture was the best day of his life, until night time (assimilation) came and literally sucked the life out of it. The vampire says it was the last time he saw his \"brother\" (family) and the sun (his connection to his larger past). Then he walks out in his Cosby sweater to reap the benefits of his new \"life\". "

They have an aversion to fiction that “promotes belief in the supernatural” but they also make lots of films about Chinese mythology which often feature magic and the afterlife. Stories that promote traditional Chinese culture is encouraged. \n\nI think the fact that many aspects of Dios de los Muertos is similar to the traditional Chinese holiday Qingming made the movie’s premise more palatable to Chinese censors than other movies about ghosts. For Qingming people also place offerings to ancestors at altars and visit their ancestors’ graves. Mexican practices to honouring ancestors is very similar to Chinese cultural practices.

It looses points for me because it lacks the visual flair of the previous movie - the previous movie went WEIRD with it, and this just doesnt. \n\nI'll also knock it down because functionally the bulk of the movie is just torture porn. There's a damned sight more gore but thats because the Jimmys are a sadistic bunch. Frankly theres less Zombies, and some straight idiot plotting in places for me. Spike is functionally a supporting character in this which after he carried the first film feels like a bit of a disservice.",
      "I agree about Spike. I felt like I kept trying to focus on him, but couldn't really pin him down as the main character. I guess because they really made it Kelson's story, with Jimmy as the antagonist and Spike unwillingly along for the ride.",
      "I think the visuals for me are what make the moving pretty amazing. That first scene is really compelling and obviously ralph fiennes in the last scene is oscar worthy. It's damned damned good. Even the jimmy seeing the sky turn into an ocean is visually gripping. I agree with the torture porn callout though. It's helps turn our anxiety up and make potential consequences for spike real but it's hard sometime.",

He was an absolute villain in this.\n\nThe scene where &gt;!he sits with Kelson and talks about the old world is great.

Jimmy is the opposite. Highly traumatized sure, but has spent 28 years descending into pure evil mayhem, brutally murdering innocents in the name of Satanism.!&lt;",
      "I don’t think violence and brutality was dealt with that intelligently here, and for me that was a major selling point for the series. In 28YL, violence, loss and death in post-Rage Britain are presented as grim and tragic, in Days the parallels between the infected and non-infected are handled deftly, but this time there was a lot of sensationalisation/titillation going on. For a film where “Memento Mori, but remember you were loved” Kelson was arguably the protagonist (Fiennes was fantastic), this jarred with me. On top of that there was some“I’m gonna show the full gory reality of this violent world”which isnt my cup of tea. I wasn’t surprised by DaCosta saying in her AMA that she’d love to direct the live action version of Invincible.\n\nThe soldier section of Days was comparable but Days couldn’t have worked with that alone, and the characterisation of the soldiers was just way better than that of the Jimmies (who were in the entire film) tbh.\n\nI also wasn’t convinced by some of the science and felt the idea the infected were seeing non-infected how non-infected see infected needed a bit more work, as we’ve spent the previous films being shown it’s uncontrollable rage. With this logic, &gt;!presumably the infected began to see Samson as a threat when he spoke, which…what happened there, biologically…unless the antipsychotics actually cured the infection AND left Samson immune/a carrier - their attack on him would have reinfected him otherwise - why would the infected brain start to see him as a threat?!&lt;.",
      "&gt;! I wonder if that final jump scare with Sampson was him being reinfected. Possibly spike informs Jim of the doctors work and they go on a quest to cure another infected? Still feel conflicted about what the third film would be, but man this one was a blast!&lt;",
      "Nah I think it was a horde, or possibly another hallucination. Samson carried Kelson away and didn't bother with Jimmy. He was clearly not reinfected, they made a point of showing this when an infected woman spits in his face and he shrugs it off and kills her.\n\nI suppose the drugs could've worn off, and I assume they will. A virus like that (or even real life psychosis) doesn't just vanish after one dose of pills.",
      "maybe it impossible reinfect when psychosis is restored and body automatically produce anti virus immune adaption",
      "DaCosta doing horror paired with a competent writer is a dream, reviews are encouraging and I can’t wait to see this.",
      "I need Nia to get her flowers! If you didn’t see her AMA you should check it out, she’s delightful.",
      "I am really rooting for Nia DaCosta to have a film that’s critically and commercially successful after The Marvels was such a massive bomb.",
      "The Marvels wasn't even that bad. I actually really liked her Candyman movie",
      "The best and worst thing about Marvels is that \"fun\" sums up the whole thing. And her Candyman movie was _super_ well directed, the only problem was the script.",
      "Gut wrenchingly gruesome, Darkly Comedic at times and totally bat-shit crazy.\n\nSamsons whole story is extremely interesting and Jimmy Crystal's warped, Literally psychotic motivations were handled very well.\n\nTotally mental beyond my wildest dreams, I was a huge fan of Years and even going in knowing some themes and directions, due to my endless sleuthing, It Completely and utterly exceeded my expectations in every way.\n\nI guess my only very small let-downs would be that Spike was a bit underutilised and the Pov shots of what the infected saw were a bit 2008 YouTube Spooky face, I don't think Danny Boyle would have gone that direction at all.\n\nOther than that I loved every minute and can't wait to see it again.",
      "I love how it literally switches around how movies have always portrayed zombies.\n\nWe walk in knowing that humans are the good guys, just trying to survive against the ruthless infected.\n\nWe walk out questioning that completely.",
      "Ralph Fiennes doing a &gt;!callback to Voldemort !&lt;was something I wasn't expecting to hit on my 2026 Movie Bingo Card",
      "Just saw it! Was very different from 28 years tone wise, and much more of a horror but I loved it. VERH brutal though. Nia consistently delivers.",
      "That barnyard scene… I’m a horror movie veteran and that was tough to watch, not gonna lie",
      "The barn scene was brutal. You could see it coming too. Had to look away for most of it.",
      "28 Years Later didn’t quite hit for me - maybe I hyped it up too much after waiting so long.\n\nI just got back from seeing The Bone Temple - wow. Exceeded every expectation. Fantastic film that I’ll see time and time again. Brilliant story, Fiennes is simply outstanding. I couldn’t fault anything in it",
      "So many of these paraphrased reviews resonate with what I suspected regarding my ama question... \n\nSound like they went balls to the walls silly and that's what a lot of people appreciated (acting wise). Which is the opposite of what I originally liked about this series.",
      "I saw it last night and it’s a pretty serious/brutal film. There’s a few moments of sillyness, but not many",
      "“That’s a LOT of screaming. Does that sound like normal screaming to you? I’m overthinking it”.",
      "There were moments in 28 Years when it felt like the movie no longer took the threats seriously, like they forgot the danger of a random blood drop. Is it like that, or is it more strange people doing strange things?",
      "One of the most telling moments in Bone Temple is the brief POV shot from an infected, where we see how the uninfected are perceived. It suggests that the rage is not just loss of control, but a distortion of perception itself.\n\nWhen the film later frames the infection as involving brain hemorrhaging and psychosis, that shot starts to read as a clue. The infected are not simply violent. They are seeing the world incorrectly.\n\nJimmy’s upside down crucifixion echoes this idea. When the perspective shifts to his POV and Sampson appears with horns, the parallel becomes clear. Jimmy is not infected, yet his perception breaks in the same way. Under extreme trauma, he no longer sees a man, but a symbolic figure shaped by his own beliefs.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that Jimmy’s vision is religious in form despite his anti religious worldview. It suggests that his way of understanding the world is not fundamentally different from the infected, only filtered through a different lens. His worldview produces its own distortion, one that mirrors the infection without requiring the virus.",
      "I think the movie pointed very clearly that Jimmy had some kind of  schizophrenia.",
      "I know it was polarizing, but I adored 28 Years Later. That was one of the best movies of last year for me. I can’t wait for this one\n\nAnd tbh, this series has not had a bad movie so far. I’ve enjoyed them all",
      "They’re all good, it’s just that ending is still one of the most jarring I can recall in recent releases \n\nLike, all of a sudden it felt that I was watching a Monty Python film… and then the credits rolled. I’m impressed they got to keep that finish",
      "New one makes the specifics of that ending even more jarring to be honest.",
      "Watched it again this week when showing it to a friend - still really don't like the ending.  It's just such a strong and abrupt tonal shift.\n\nRest of the movie I like, but even knowing what to expect, the ending had me wince a bit",
      "In the context of the trilogy, it makes a lot of sense to put such an absurd jarring moment because it acts as a cliff hanger. It was unexpected but I definitely wanted to see what these characters were all about. The pay off was worth it imo",
      "I thought it was bullshit to make Alfie Williams’ role to be basically nothing after his breakthrough performance in the previous movie.",
      "BONE????",
      "Man i feel like im in the minority cause i really didnt like this. \n\nI really liked Years but was incredibly let down by this. It felt tonally all over the place and I felt the Jimmys were very one dimensional. I missed the style Boyle brought. I missed the focus on the coming of age story.\n\nRalph Fines was great sbd i liked how kind he is despite the world around him."

Yes, it would be hard shoes to fill, but actual pushback I think would have been minimum because pretty much any slightly rational person would understand that wasn’t some executive BS.\n\nBut having T’Challa pass with Chadwick, and have (I’m sorry, the much less charismatic) Letitia with Shuri was a mistake.",
      "Almost soon after he passed, there was a petition going around, asking for Shuri to be the next Black Panther. I thought it was a little too soon. I'm generally of the same mind though. I don't think any actor should own any role and think it should be okay to recast.",
      "Letita Wright has posted a ton of really fucked up stuff. She went down a conspiracy rabbit hole and seems to have settled there. We're talking like \"Jewish space lazers\" levels",

She says a bunch of stupid covid stuff and gets fired over it (though she also did some stupid stuff after she got fired) however Letita also posts a bunch of stupid covid stuff and remains in Disney?\n\nI don’t think Carano should have been fired for what she initially said, though she did kind of dig her own grave by doubling down, nor am I saying that Letita should have been. It’s just frustrating that what was good for the goose wasn’t for the gander and that bugs me.",

IMO, she’s the least interesting wakandan character by a sizable margin, it genuinely felt like she was just characterised as “young enough that everyone underestimates her so she can turn around and out science people like Stark”.\n\nPersonally, I’d like to have shifted from it being a black panther film to a wakanda films and focused on the Dora Milaje, or, and this is my personal preference, a spy thriller focused on Nakia.",

Compared to where how many Marvel sequels as of late get caught in development hell.",
      "I will forever wish they had black panther 2 with either Kilmonger or M'Baku and had Shuri continue to be built up before making her the main Panther.

One panther was enough when we were hidden, but we’re in the world now, and we saw what other countries did when we didn’t have a panther, so rather than a panther, we have panthers”. \n\nYes, it’s a deviation from the comics, but it’s not like they’ve never deviated - Darcy, Wasp, Coulson, and Sylvie are new, and the original Nick Fury was as white as Captain America.",
      "Didn't Nick Fury get his directly inspired by Jackson reboot before Iron Man? \n\nI do like the idea of there becoming a black panther army (and the obvious struggle with how that would be very not-ok) but I imagine that wouldn't screen well due to optics in the... current political climate to put it nicely.",
      "Yes, he did. Ultimate Nick Fury was modeled after Sam L. Jackson, and he first showed up very early on in Ultimate Marvel Team-Up (which was one of the first comics launched after Ultimate Spider-Man iirc). His first appearance was in 2001.\n\nSo he was obviously the perfect casting for the character when the time came.\n\nHe went over so well that they eventually kind of retired Nick Fury in the regular Marvel comic universe and replaced him with his biracial son, Nick Fury Jr, who was basically just Ultimate Nick Fury but in the regular universe.\n\nHe's one of the few more recent characters to be directly inspired by a living person. The other notable one being Miles Morales/Donald Glover.",
      "Well, with the multiverse, we can. Or have T'Challa's son age up through time shenanigans.",
      "lmao how would bringing back a clearly deceased character who’s arc heavily revolves around him dying be more compelling than Shuri reluctantly taking on the mantle 💀",
      "Yeah bringing back Killmonger is a nonstarter and would make the original *BP* movie worse. Swapping in a multiverse variant is also the exact way not to use the multiverse and leads to zero stakes within the story.",
      "I still contend that based on the events in BP1 Nakia should have become the next Black Panther.  She is the one who convinces T'Challa to open Wakanda's resources to the world.  She's the one who told Okoye to not obey Killmonger after becoming the BP solely due to tradition.  She's the one who saved the heart shaped herb, which ended up saving T'Challa.  And IMO most importantly, she initially tried to give the heart herb to M'Baku before learning that T'Challa was not dead.\n\nShe never wanted the power of the Black Panther, but she did everything to keep Wakanda safe.  Her shunning the role of the hero while simultaneously being a hero sets up the classic reluctant hero arc that could have been written in BP2.",

Endgame had a 5 year time jump, we could be facing a soft reboot that could allow T’Challa to age up less organically, time dilation on Battleworld, have him take the herb earlier and do a teenage Panther, have the herb/Bast age him up to “protect Wakanda from a great evil” or something. If they choose that path, Coogler’s got a good enough track record that I’m sure he’ll figure it out.",
      "I'd really like to see Coogler tackle a original script with a scope comparable to Black Panther. I really hoped that when the first Black Panther made a billion dollars it would kick off some more interest in giving afro-fantasy/futurism a chance on the big screen...but that just never really manifested.",
      "That's a shame. I can't imagine anything less interesting that Coogler could do than return to Black Panther. ",
      "Yeah, but money.",
      "Considering his Sinners deal and the state of the MCU, he’d probably be better off making an original",
      "As big a success *Sinners* was it didn’t even make half of what *Wakanda Forever* made so I think even just from a money perspective Coogler and Disney probably think there’s still some juice left in that franchise.",
      "It didn’t cost as much as Wakanda Forever did either.",
      "If he doesn’t do it marvel will get someone way less competent to make it. I’m fine with him finishing off the trilogy and having the financial freedom to pursue more interesting projects after",

It may be argued that a lot of them went that way due to lack of opportunities at home thanks to the English jackboot, but I'm not sure that particularly mattered to any poor sod who met their end at the bayonet of an Enniskillen man or a Highlander's claymore. Certainly not all of them were common soldiers with little option either, plenty were officer class or held high-ranking administrative posts throughout the Empire.\n\nRegiments like the 74th Highland were used as shock troops during late 18th century Indian campaigns (operating largely in the interests of the East India Company) and the Connaught Rangers established a pretty fearsome reputation during the Napoleonic wars (usually as part of General Wellesley's army, another Irishman).",

They are the descendants of Scottish colonial settlers who undertook the plantation of Ulster. This is when the British crown transferred land ownership from the native Catholic Irish population to a colonial Protestant Scottish population. Laws were put in place to prevent Catholics owning land and a systemic attempt was made to eradicate the Irish language and culture. This has present day ramifications in the existence of Northern Ireland, where there remains a cultural divide between mostly Protestants who would describe themselves as British, and mostly Catholics who would describe themselves as Irish (this divide has become less pronounced in recent years). \n\nObviously, that’s not to say Irish Catholics didn’t go on to be racist in America, but in this situation I felt the film made them Scots Irish to accentuate an attempting to draw a commonality between people of Irish and West African descent, both in their history but also their musical culture.",

      "I imagine he read and watched Salem's Lot, Midnight Mass, and From Dusk Till Dawn.",
      "i feel like i should give midnight mass another chance. everyone keeps saying it is good. i tried watching it and gave up like 1.5 episodes in because it was so boring.",
      "Probably an unpopular opinion, but it stays boring and it honestly made me a bit of a Flanagan hater. I like a lot of his work, but he succumbs to some of his worst tendencies in Midnight Mass.",
      "If you don't love Flanagan's dialogue like Flanagan does, then it won't be for you.\n\nAlso depends on your expectatons I think. It's a drama with some fairly mild horror rather than a horror series imo. Going into it expecting a full blown horror certainly left me disappointed. and bored.",
      "the first part is my favorite, the rest feels derivative",
      "All of Salem's Lot is slow, that is why it is such a perfect book. The beginning of Sinners is not even slow. It is getting the gang back together like the Muppet Movie so you care about everyone before everything that happens later.",
      "dudes creates fully fleshed out characters in that time. I loved getting to know everyone and seeing the subtle character interactions that built history.",
      "I prefer the first half!",
      "YES! I left the theatre telling my husband, \"forget twilight sparkly vampires shit, these were Salem's Lot vampires and they're fucking TERRIFYING\"",
      "He literally says this on Democracy Now. Good call.",
      "That’s wild, the first half is pretty much perfect.",

      "Namely because King is so good at creating detailed communities and worlds and lots of interesting characters.\n\n\nCooler does the same with \"Sinners.\" Not only is he setting things up and introducing us to the world, he keeps bringing in good characters who are all well defined (especially Delroy Lindo's veteran musician; would be wonderful if he got an Oscar nod for that).",

      "The director of *Sinners* knew that it was time to break out of his comfort zone, David Sims writes.⁠\n\nRyan Coogler has made five movies, all of them well-received hits—especially *Black* *Panther* and its sequel, which became a cultural phenomenon and a high-water mark for Marvel. *Sinners*, a strange, heady piece of horror set in the Jim Crow Deep South, is his first entirely original work. He tells Sims that the film “came from a place inside of myself I wasn’t sure existed.”⁠\n\n⁠“I got afraid, bro,” Coogler said. “Because when you’re working with other things, there’s also something to hide behind a little bit. It takes quite a bit of the pressure off. And the reality is, you’re less exposed if somebody doesn’t like it.” He continued: “I didn’t want to get caught up in the comfort of not being fully exposed. I didn’t want to look back at myself and say, ‘Man, I was chickenshit.’ So I went for it with this one.”⁠\n\nCoogler called *Sinners* a love letter to a blues-obsessed uncle from Mississippi, and wanted the film to “feel like you were reading ‘Salem’s Lot’ while listening to the best blues record.”⁠\n\n“This music is maybe our country’s greatest homegrown contribution. I had no idea of the epic nature of what was made in this place at this time,” Coogler said, “that became global pop culture. That was just flat-out astonishing, to think that these people that weren’t even considered full human beings by the state could make an art form that’s such a lightning rod.”⁠\n\nCoogler had faced doubts when making *Black* *Panther*, among them that a film with a predominantly Black cast wouldn’t do well overseas. “That brings this full circle—like, the music made by a Black sharecropper with a guitar,” he told Sims. “How am I going to take that to Sweden? But there you have it. Everything you’re saying is true, and I believe in the value of the media. I don’t think it goes away. I pray it doesn’t. I love walking into a dark room with a bunch of strangers and a trailer rolling. The movie starts, and shit gets weird, and you hear people react to it. I love that feeling.”⁠⁠\n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/APS0TF7Y](https://theatln.tc/APS0TF7Y) \n\n— Evan McMurry, senior audience editor, *The Atlantic*",
      "Oh hey! That's one of the two best friends!",
      "This is hilarious title given &gt;! one of the recurring aspects of the film is female pleasure and female sexuality. Oral for one of the female  characters, girl spitting in a guy's mouth, an old love reconnecting with a main character by sex after a shared memory of a tragedy. Is Ryan scared of these things? Haha !&lt;",
      "I’m scared of all those things and don’t ANYBODY even DARE to try and scare me this Halloween with ANY of that!! 🙏",
      "Did anyone else feel like this was very “From Dusk till Dawn” in the best possible way",
      "Thank you, yes.",
      "A pretty direct source of inspo, along with Salem’s lot",
      "The amount of times they talk about coochy coo coo, I get it, it’s a scary thing to worry about",
      "Assimilation and the commodification/theft of art are fairly terrifying.",
      "IP gigs might be the key to more original films from him. I just hope he doesn't get stuck in that box for long",
      "So...white people?🤣",
      "He must have run afoul of an Irishman in his past.\nhttps://youtu.be/50Tq0K3HyP4?si=jiTz11H3bXV-dw6A",
      "Jokes aside, the movie actually does a great job showing how even white people have been colonised and controlled into believing dumb stuff. Kinda reminds me of his Black Panther movies having a very wholesome message about communities being together to progress.",
      "I mean I think the movie says more on capitalism than it does on race. What is the motivation the vampires use to get themselves inside. Gold. And these vampires specifically don't \"kill\" as in the way of prey is solely food. Their souls become hollow. Accept capital, invite the sin of profit above else, lose your sole. Reflects his fears of making the Marvel Disney Machine a billion dollars.",
      "Yeah that's a fair take, the movie has multiple themes going on. I was just replying to OP that it doesn't frame it as white people are the bad guys kinda thing just like Coogler's previous work. I also don't know if he has had issues with Marvel for him to say that but who knows. I know the rumour is that Favreau's Chef is about working under a massive franchise like the MCU but not sure that's confirmed either.",
      "(White) People always wanna deemphasize race for class, 🙄",
      "He must be terrified of licking pussy then",
      "&gt;!Why? You'll note the only one to survive the night was the who actually liked doing that... eating pussy saves lives!&lt;",
      "It's a terrific film with one particular amazing scene involving music but I was surprised it had such a high budget of 90million.\n\nMaybe the cast, being shot in IMAX and multiple formats or the economy ballooned the budget but I thought this cost like 50million like Creed.",
      "Incoherent and non-sensical action scenes? \n\n\nHaha I liked Sinners but man those parts were rougher than a badgers hole",
      "Interesting buildup to a boring fight that was visually confusing with little payoff.",
      "It makes sense. Every successful writer talk about how their fears drives their stories. Story writers in general tend to have anxiety about the world, otherwise they wouldn’t be writing stories. Conflict, tension, and struggles are all about fear. And themes are typically based on a concept writers want to discuss or lesson they want to teach about their fears.",
      "Such a great movie, going to have to comeback to read this.",
      "I had a good time with this movie. As a Brit however, half the time I felt like I didn't know what anyone was saying with those thick accents. Did anyone else feel this?",
      "The irony of yourself comment is gonna be lost on many. Maybe even you.",
      "Dude talks like blues is some hidden genre the world would never accept. Weird.",
      "No, he is saying that it's odd that the blues was so popular around the world when the people making it wouldn't be accepted at a high table anywhere it was played.",
      "That was literally a line in the movie. People love hearing the blues, just just don't like the people who make it",
      "Yes it was. That's why I was saying it for the person above who didn't seem to catch that.",
      "At a high table in the US. Hence why so many black musicians went to the UK and Europe during the blues peak (late 50's into 60's)",
      "No Coogler pointed out the hypocrisy of black people being treated as less than human while the music they produced was adored.",
      "…….i don’t think you understand what he said"
