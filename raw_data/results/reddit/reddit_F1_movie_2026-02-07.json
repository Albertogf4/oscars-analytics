    "'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' - Official Teaser Poster": [
      "This thread is surprisingly positive towards this movie.",
      "[deleted]",
      "Remember the 3rd movie when they assembled hundreds of ships and only 3 actually fought? ",
      "[deleted]",
      "Yup! That's also probably why the kraken was randomly dead with posthumous explanation.",
      "THAT was the biggest \"WTF guys...\" moment in the movie. Naval battle blue balls.",
      "One ship just spawned a gargantuan sea-hag that turned into a mass of crabs and summoned a maelstrom. The other is literally the Flying Dutchman captained by Davy Jones, God of the sea and ferryman of the dead, that was summoned anew from the depths of the ocean after being sunk into the sea.\n\nThen they both come and wipe out your flagship in literally seconds AND they have a decent armada of their own with the added benefits of an \"impenetrable fortress.\"\n\nTell me how eager you would be to fight that one.\n\nOh, and by the way, you're not a soldier, you're a mercenary working for a company.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention all the tales you've heard that have been confirmed such as one of these ships having an immortal, zombie crew that can sack a royal fortress city alone.",
      "I think it's because everyone is still in love with the PotC universe. Even if they aren't as good as they used to be, they're never so bad that it's offensive, and you're still glad you watched it.",
      "It helps that they don't just pump them out asap. At least for me it gives the impression that they care more about making a good movie than selling tickets",
      "Also Johnny Depp is a great Jack Sparrow.",
      "pretty much this. I always watch these films because I enjoy that character and his performance way too much. Sure the films havent been as good as the first couple, but its still entertaining.",
      "The casting, particularly the pirates, has always been exceptional, as is the character development and production values.\n\nI think they should get a cameo from Michael Bolton.",
      "They're like pizza. When they're good, they're great. When they're bad, they're still pretty good. ",
      "I kind of see it like the Harry Potter universe: expansive, wonderful, full of unique and amazing creatures/story lines, yet the plot that brought us this world is lacking in certain areas",
      "[deleted]",
      "Wish I could read them again for the first time.",
      "The first one was nearly perfect. The others have disappointed. We want the first one again. Only new.",
      "Seems like we need JJ Abrams",
      "He needs some vacation after rebooting the National anthem.",
      "I thought jack sparrow was a dead meme by now",
      "But you have heard of meme",
      "You are by far the worst meme I have ever heard of.",
      "Why are the memes always gone?",
      "dead memes tell no tales\n",
      "Wow.\n\nThis film series lasted longer than my marriage. ",
      "If it makes you feel any better, gap between this movie and the last one lasted longer than Johnny Depp's marriage.",
      "pirate movies and shows,my guilty pleasure, i dont care if they are good or bad i just like that whole universe.",
      "[deleted]",
      "[deleted]",
      "I am in the same boat as you, partner. Black Sails is to Pirates as Vikings is to... Well, Vikings. Both terrific shows. ",
      "Agreed, it is pretty underrated. Surprising, given that it got better and better after every season.",
      "Honestly I find that is the case with most Starz shows.  They get really quality programming that gets largely overlooked. I'm guessing because of the channel.  I loved when they were partnered with Netflix back in the day and I was able to catch all my shows even though I didn't have Starz. ",
      "The first season starts slow but by the end and in season 2 it becomes amazing.\n",
      "Black sails is among my most favorite shows ever. Definitely worth a watch!",
      "I always liked it when educational channels would bandwagon. Pirates of the Carribean is getting a lot of hype? Time for non-stop pirate shows.\n\nNow it *might* result in a special episode of Pawn Stars. :/",
      "I got a pirate guy here in town. let me call him up",
      "I’m Jack Sparrow, and this is my Black Pearl. I work here with my first mate and my blacksmith, Will Turner. Everything in here has a curse and a price. One thing I’ve learned after 100 years – you never know WHAT is gonna come to collect your debt.",
      "CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow",
      "Ever play Black Flag?",
      "Muppet Treasure Island was where it was at",
      "Boom Shaka Laka!",
      "A talking parrot? What next, a singing dancing mouse with his own amusement park???",
      "Aye, plus Captain Jack Sparrow is always a sight for sore eyes. His charisma just oozes off the screen. ",
      "Especially with some voodoo thrown in, like Monkey Island ",
      "[deleted]",
      "I heard this one was about stealing Poseidon's trident, and the trident on the skull seems to confirm that\n",

      "Holy heck",
      "While it's an awesome twist I know, I was expecting a movie about mid 1800s tax accountants, and I feel like I'm not going to get the economic thriller I was hoping for.",

      "I love the dark pirate setting ever since I went on the ride as a kid.",
      "Well the thing is they are still competent movies, they're adventure movies, which is something we sorely lack right now since superhero movies basically started moving in to replace them. 2-3 tip the scale more towards action but 1 is a classic adventure movie like The Mummy or Indiana Jones. I would never say that, as movies, they are as empty and soulless as The Transformer movies for example, which ARE just high budgeted eye-candy without much to them outside of that.\n\nThen again what product placement could you put in PoTC, the East India Co. are about the closest you got...",
      "First footage debuts tonight! ([Announcement Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld1XovTl-Nc))",

      "This is a thing now. Gotta get those delicious delicious clicks yo.",
      "Wasn't the first Pirates movie literally about dead men telling tales?\n\nEdit: They're close enough to dead for a joke, damn. You all must be fun at parties.",
      "Well...it's more what you'd call a guideline...",
      "Hell yes. I unabashedly love this franchise and can't wait for the next movie. The only problem I had with the last one is they spent a lot of time walking on land. I just want more adventure on the open seas. ",
      "I unabashedly love Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa. ",
      "I'm not convinced he isn't just a real pirate who was kidnapped and forced to act.",
      "Well it was the PotC franchise that got me into the actor. And he's fucking brilliant in everything he does. \n\nThough I shouldn't discount the possibility that he's a pirate that also happens to be an insanely talented actor as well. ",
      "Yay! New Pirate movie! Don't care if it's good or bad I love me some Jack Sparrow!",
      "I've actually liked almost all of these films.\n3 was a bit tooo long but still entertaining, and 4 was just fun yet flawed.\n\nDisney has really cornered the relax and just enjoy it market for films.",
      "The first one was amazing, the second and third were good but complex, at least the fourth was fun. This one got delayed so much it probably cost $300 million to make but I hope its good.",
      "I always thought the second one was the best. Loved the Davy Jones stuff before it got a bit too convoluted in the third. Plus that threeway fight on that beach was awesome. ",
      "Hell yeah, My favorite scene in the whole franchise has to be when Jack is getting chased by all those dudes down the beach, That shit is crease up material guaranteed ",
      "The whole island sequence is great.",
      "And Davy is one of the best CG characters out there (even after all those years)",
      "There's something about this series that makes me excited for every new movie. I didn't think the last two were very good but I can't wait to see this one.\n\nEdit: Before this, my highest upvoted comment was only at 109. It's fitting that I'd beat that on a post about Pirates of the Caribbean. ",

      "I'm glad that Orlando Bloom's character is coming back. The mermaid couple in #4 was boring as hell, and did a piss poor job at trying to fill the void left by Bloom &amp; Knightley's characters. \n\nHopefully with the delayed production time, they have a much stronger story and script to go alongside the new directorial talent behind the camera. Really hoping they can finally get back to the quality level of the first film.",

      "NOW BACK TO THE GOOD PART!",
      "I think I'm one of a dozen people who really like the third movie. Fourth was, well, not terrible but just forgettable.\n\nI'm excited for the fifth nonetheless.",
      "Same! Especially since it's supposed to be a soft reboot of the first. It's all we've been talking about at /r/piratesofthecaribbean. \n\nWe're so excited for the first look tonight we're nervous. ",
      "And Orlando Bloom finally gets to play a character other than the \"beautiful romantic hero\" role! We get to see him as Davy Jones and he's gonna look all fucked up from years at the bottom of the ocean.\n\n(Bloom himself said this during an interview)\n\nIt's a soft reboot because all of the characters previously presented as leads will now be supporting cast, the movie will be from the PoV of Will Turners son.\n\nEDIT: Grammar",
      "Davy Jones only looked fucked up because he wasn't doing his job.  Or is Bloom playing a new version? ",
      "Yeah I doubt Will Turner will turn into a fish man but I'm sure a decade or two in the underworld guiding souls has taken it's toll.",

      "they have new directors and this one has a chance of at least being a decent movie. There was a recent mumbling that Depp was being a little bitch and holding up production alot during this movie, they even contemplated killing off Jack Sparrow",
      "&gt; they even contemplated killing off Jack Sparrow\n\nAnd the entire franchise with him. Seriously, Jack is the heart and soul of these stories.",
      "He's certainly become the biggest part of the series now but I'd personally argue that the reason the series goes downhill after the first one is that the character really only works well in a supporting role/shared protagonist role, as they moved forward they made Jack more and more the sole protagonist and he just doesn't work well that way",
      "Agreed, it worked much better where Will was the \"main character\" with the hero's journey, and Jack was the supporting role.",
      "Johnny Deep might actually believe he is Captain Jack Sparrow at this point like Tom Cruise believes Mission Impossible is actually a documentary.  ",
      "There's something about this poster that annoys me, but I can't tell what it is. Maybe the off-centered skull?",

    "I saw 290 movies in theaters in 2025. Here is my full ranking.": [
      "I don't want to jump to conclusions here, but I think OP really likes to go to the movies.",
      "guilty as charged!\n\ni've even saved all 1,827 ticket stubs: https://i.imgur.com/jvLvdLJ.jpeg",
      "When I was a bachelor my roommate and I would hit up the movies quite a bit.  Once we wanted to watch something on streaming.  I don't even recall what it was.  He wanted movie popcorn so we drove to the movie theater and bought one.  Popcorn dude asked what we were seeing and he said, \"At home?  Tell you what.  When this runs out you pause that shit and come back and I'll fill this up for you\"\n\nSo we did.  Fun times.  It 2008/2009 or so.",
      "My local AMC in on food delivery service platforms. I think it started during Covid but they have an at home popcorn “kit” which is a huge bag of popped corn and a squirt bottle full of fake butter. It’s a decadent expense but my girlfriend has a couple chronic illnesses that sometimes keep her bed bound for a few days so it’s worth it to have a little at home movie theater experience occasionally.",
      "That's very nice of you.  My ex roommate and I both work in industrial fields and joke that the synthetic movie theater butter is a better lubricant than you can find for most bearings.",
      "I really should be commenting on your rankings but I will just say that I admire you as a human for committing to the movies this much, and the fact that you've saved all your ticket stubs is a very attractive quality.  Nice work.",
      "OP do you work in media as a reviewer? How do you find the time?",
      "Most Americans spend hours a day consuming media. It’s just a matter of prioritizing film over tv/youtube/instagram",
      "This person's going to a million film festivals though and saved over a thousand ticket stubs. Far from your average cinema goer.\n\nMight be a reviewer.",
      "Idk, their last three years have been 325, 298, 290...sounds like they are slacking!",
      "Okay, it turns out Michael Bolton is a major cinephile.",
      "You complete me!",
      "Big, if true.",
      "How dare you",
      "Incredible...I thought I liked movies haha. \n\nGenuine question, what did you get out of watching One Battle After Another 7x? I loved it but I can't see what you are squeezing out of it to watch it that many times within a short period.",
      "OP is Sean Penn",
      "He's not gay. If that's what you asking.",
      "Maybe just horny",
      "we need more horny cinema",
      "I had never seen a movie in theaters more than 3x before **OBAA**. It's just so rewatchable for me. It totally flies by. You pick up new stuff each time (and to be fair the 7th time was because Regina Hall was announced as a last-minute Q&amp;A guest for the screening and there was no world where I was missing that).",
      "One one battle after another after another one battle after another.",
      "It's interesting how people's tastes are so different. I saw OBAA once and I wouldn't watch it again. I thought it was okay, but nothing special.\n\nMy most favourite movie experience was watching Heat a few years ago when TIFF reran it at midnight.\n\nReally appreciate your list, nice work.",
      "I watched it three times over like two weeks. I could watch it again.\n\n\nUp front it's just incredibly well paced. Like OP said it just flies by somehow. But there's so much attention to detail. There's so many small insignificant things that are given no highlights that come in later. I definitely think there's a strong argument for watching it twice because there's a lot of stuff with Bob at the start of the movie pre-kid that seems like dressing and knowing how he ends up and what he has to deal with makes it more interesting. And the performances are really good. Sean Penn is so goddamn weird but still grounded in a way that feels vaguely like I've met that kind of guy before. Leo being a struggling fuck up who's energy is at a 10 almost the whole movie is super entertaining. And in particular the whole segment where hes with Del Toro is amazing for what is happening as a whole. There is so much to take in between what Bob's doing, what Del Toro is doing, and what the background is doing. There's some really entertaining coregraphy for that whole portion of the movie.",
      "Choosing to voluntarily watch “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” more than once says a lot \n\nI liked that movie too, just pure anxiety the whole way",
      "That's one of the movies I'd probably never re-watch but [Rose Byrne was at the 2nd screening](https://i.imgur.com/1aTUE3q.jpeg) for Q&amp;A (along with the director Mary Bronstein) so I couldn't *not* go lol. There were tons of walkouts at that one though. Imagine walking out before Rose fucking' Byrne comes on for a Q&amp;A. Couldn't be me.\n\nThe movies that had the most walkouts this year:\n\n* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You**\n* **[The Chronology of Water](https://i.imgur.com/iRt4Y0a.jpeg)** (i swear at least 150 people walked out of this one)\n* **[The Testament of Ann Lee](https://i.imgur.com/HzGkRUj.jpeg)** \n\nThe first two make sense. Those movies are *aggressive*. They actively don't give a shit about your feelings. They want to make you feel like shit. **Ann Lee** makes no sense, nobody should be walking out of that. If you walk out of **Ann Lee** we can't be friends.\n\nSome of my favorite Q&amp;As of the year:\n\n* **[Hamnet](https://i.imgur.com/lz0ckDo.jpeg)** (Chloe Zhao, Paul Mescal, Jessie Buckley, Noah Nupe, Jacobi Jupe, Emily Watson)\n* **[I Love LA](https://i.imgur.com/LG1KBNe.jpeg)** (Rachel Sennott, Odessa A'Zion, True Whitaker)\n* **[Left-Handed Girl](https://i.imgur.com/PGUjHY0.jpeg)** (Shih-Ching Tsou, Nina Ye, Shih-Yuan Ma)\n* **[Highest 2 Lowest](https://i.imgur.com/Xw82HNO.jpeg)** (Spike Lee)\n* **[Blood for Dracula](https://i.imgur.com/Y4tPY9i.jpeg)** (Udo Kier, RIP)\n\nThe two biggest standing ovations I was a part of this year:\n\n* **[Christy](https://imgur.com/a/Bpr1MO4)** (Played really well at TIFF, not so much everywhere else)\n* **[Frankenstein](https://i.imgur.com/7kEFgcG.jpeg)** (There was probably 100+ cast/crew there for this one, including all of the big stars and GDT. It's a hometown movie (Toronto, for TIFF), so this was a no-brainer.)",
      "Holy shit. I wanted to go to that Q&amp;A at Lincoln Square. Shocked to read there were walkouts. It’s an intense movie like Uncut Gems…. But Rose should be nominated for Best Actress. I wouldn’t walk out on that potential Q&amp;A unless I was having a legit panic attack. ",
      "Q&amp;As are my favorite part of festivals so I stay whenever I can, even if I don't love the movie. Sometimes the Q&amp;A will even make up for a disappointing movie.",
      "why were there walkouts? can you tell me with the spoiler tag added. idc, I'm not going to actually watch it",
      "The one trailer I saw made it look like a fun comedy with Rose Byrne and Conan O'brien in it. \n\nThe actual movie is a woman with crumbling mental health having the world fall apart around her as her mental health deteriorates. It's more so sad and messed up that you end up laughing as a defense mechanism than a comedy. \n\nRoofman did a similar thing where the trailer made it look like a fun romcom with a wacky premise. The actual movie is super sad. \n\nIn my showings of both some people left like a third of the way through the movie. I'm guessing the people felt baited and switched by the trailers and asked to swap tickets for a different movie.",
      "That’s a great description. But when I saw “If I Had Legs..”, there were two guys a couple of rows in front of me who were absolutely *baked* and were laughing their asses off at it. Was quite the dissonance!",
      "Not OP, but here’s the “spoiler free” plot:\n\nPicture “Uncut Gems” if you saw or heard about that movie, but from the perspective of a mom with a daughter who has a gastrointestinal issue that requires a tube inserted in her belly, a husband who serves and is constantly gone, and you were forced to move temporarily because there was structural damage done to your home. Oh! And you’re a therapist by trade.\n\nPace moves at a frantic anxiety from beginning to end ",

      "Yep, very recently, a few weeks after the Q&amp;A. Legend.",
      "Yep. I also felt that way about Bugonia.",
      "Single-handedly keeping the film industry alive.",
      "it's not much, but its honest work.",
      "Really cool write up, but I can't help but laugh at your use of the spoiler tag. Like, it's really pretty obvious what word is being concealed each time, haha.",
      "I know I wish more of the sentence was spoiler tagged, messed me up for a movie i’ve been wanting to watch.",
      "Thank you for this, I was about to read more of the post but you've helped me realise I shouldn't!  Absolutely people should not spoiler just one word - spoiler tags should always be made in a way that you can't guess the result.",
      "listen it could be anything!",
      "you need to include more words to the spoiler tag. preferably the actor/character name.",
      "Interested in hearing more about how you were able to see I Love LA in theaters. (I'm a huge Rachel Sennott fan)",
      "It was a special screening at the Savannah Film Festival, a few days before it premiered on HBO. They played the first two episodes. Rachel, Odessa, and True were there for intro and Q&amp;A after:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rFmqM85.jpeg\n\nRachel also stayed to sign stuff after and got to say hi/get **Shiva Baby** signed:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qnE5rwG.jpeg\n\nReally fun time. She rocks.",
      "Absolutely incredible. I must ask, what is going on with Odessa's face?\n\nSide note: It's really neat to see a moderator of a sub have a real passion for what they moderate.",
      "Here are some reviews/thoughts I had to cut to fit the maximum character count:\n\n* **The Threesome** - 8/10 - Really really really great stuff. Smart, funny, heartfelt. It could be a really cheesy setup (threesome goes horribly wrong), but it takes lots of turns you don't expect and it's super smartly written and excellently acted (especially Zoey Deutsch). Sweet little comfort movie. Dope soundtrack too.\t\n\n* **Final Destination: Bloodlines** 8/10 - I've always had a soft-spot for the original, but the other movies didn't do much for me and I even skipped some. Was originally going to skip this one but really glad I didn't. A new high-point for the series. Kind of everything I want in a horror. Funny, surprisingly, nasty/hilarious kills. It subverts your expectations at every corner and has one of the best mic-drop endings of the year. Give me more\n\n* **Bring Her Back** - 8/10  Jesus christ. Really great horror film, and apart from one very weird/jarring/out-of-place tonal shift near the end (when there's the cleaning montage and the one-liner of the girl playing ball), it's consitent throughout.\t\n\n* **Christy** - 7/10 - It’s a boxing biopic with a tragic 2nd act and a happy ending. You’ve seen it a million times, but really solid lead performances from Sydney Sweeney (in her best role yet) and Ben Foster (at his most reviling) and a sweeping, war-movie-like orchestral score keep it engaging throughout. Chad Coleman only has a few minutes of screentime but he makes them memorable as Don King, highlight of the movie for me. In a just world, he’d get Supporting Actor Oscar buzz. \t\n\n* **The Surfer** - 7/10 - Pretty challenging watch and will test a lot of people's patience but it ultimately pays off, even though you're left with a lot of questions (in a good way). Another classic weird-Cage performance that builds up perfectly. Loved all of the extremely-uncomfortable close-ups. You doubt yourself for a lot of the movie which I really enjoyed.\t\n* **Blue Heron** - 7/10 - Canada's *We Need To Talk About Kevin*. Unfortunately, the subtitles weren't on during my screening so I probably missed some important stuff, but it's an impressive debut film with a complicated-but-well-done timeline.\t\n\n* **A Big Beautiful Journey** - 7/10 - Everyone hates it, I liked it. Yes it drags a bit in the middle and some of the 'visiting the past' scenes are weird (50-year old Colin Farrell confessing love to his 15-year old high school crush...?), and I would pay money for the 3-minute Burger King ad in the middle to not exist, but the soundtrack/needle drops were built in a lab specifically for me and there's a lot of sweet moments. It's corny in the best way, filled with goofy lines like \"I prefer to feel nervous with you than nothing alone\", which just kinda worked for me.\t\n\n* **The Wizard of the Kremlin** - 7/10 - There's a 9/10 movie in here somewhere with some better editing/pacing. Literally all of the first ~30 minutes can be cut. Jeffrey Wright can be cut, Alicia Vikander can be cut. Concentrate more on Putin and you've got a stew going. Right now, it's a bunch of solid potential and great performances that result in not much of anything. Paul Dano trying to play a teenager for a few scenes was very not good. Good movie, could be a lot better.\n\n* **On Swift Horses** - 7/10 - A bit long and melodramatic but kept you engaged enough (with two intertwined storylines) to keep it interesting. Daisy Edgar Jones is great (+ some steamy lesbian sex scenes for all u sick pervs). Kinda over Jacob Elordi's schtick though. He's played the same character for like 5 movies in a row. He's always just doing a James Dean impression.\t\n\n* **Rust** - 7/10 - Went in with rock-bottom expectations but it was surprisingly solid. Very well writen and well shot, with solid performances (especially Travis Fimmel, one of the best supporting performances of the year so far). It's definitely a bit slow and long (most people will get bored), but the dialogue really works and there's a lot of depth to the worldbuilding. Hard to ignore the tragedy during the movie though, the movie starts off with someone accidentally shooting someone and you're just like \"oof\".\t\n\n* **If I Had Legs I'd Kick You** - 6/10 - Rose Byrne puts in an incredible performance and is supported by a great cast, especially Conan O’Brien and ASAP Rocky) who’s starting to pop up and standout in lots of things recently), but the constant close-ups and confusing drug &amp; alcohol-induced blow-ups keep it from going great. They got a bit repetitive. The smashed-hamster to lasagna sequence was top-tier as far as transitions go though. \t\n\n* **Hard Truths** - 5/10 - Introduces you to possibly the most irritating character ever put on the big screen (and not in a good way like *Naked*), with zero redeeming qualities and no arc, with a frustratingly pointless ending. Very very rough. I know that Mike Leigh won't hold your hand and answer all of the questions, but sheesh, I needed something more. Huge disappointment.\n\n* **Fuze** - 5/10 -  I haven’t seen a third act derailment this bad since *White Noise*. Just a total mess in the last 30 minutes that completely kills a somewhat-decent premise. I don't know if David Mackenzie has another *Hell or High Water* in him.\n\n* **Eastern Western** - 3/10 - If you thought Kevin Costner's *Horizon* was slow, wait until you get a hold of this. The hardest I had to fight to slay asleep all year. Would make for a good white noise machine to fall asleep.\t\n\n* **High Rollers** - 3/10 - You'll see a lot of people joke about movies being money laundering schemes, but this could *actually* be one. The director, Randall Emmett, is probably the shadiest dude in Hollywood. He keeps bankrolling John Travolta's straight-to-the-garbage-bin movies somehow. A documentary about how his films are made would undoubetdly be more interesting than this trash.\n\n* **Good American Family** - 3/10 - Garbage streaming true-crime slop. Very messy. It wants to be serious and dark but it's so cartoony and poorly executed. It's filmed like a car commercial. But Mark Duplass is the champion of indie film so I'll always support.

I started rating stuff in Netflix in the early 2000s which only had five stars. I moved it over to IMDB which is 10 stars but I just went with 2/4/6/8/10 to keep it consistent. I don’t rate individual TV episodes but I’ll rate a series I’ve seen a lot of. I also rate short films. Out of 4849 ratings:\n\n10 - 1092  \n8 - 1802  \n6 - 1403  \n4 - 463  \n2 - 82  \n\nBasically 10: “fantastic! I want to see it again!”, 8: “Quite enjoyed it and would happily watch again.”, 6: “Decent or Ok but I don’t need to see it again.”, 4: “Meh, you tried, but I’d decline if asked to rewatch.”, and 2: “Properly terrible or so bad I couldn’t finish it.” \n\nIt’s really more a way of keeping track of what I’ve watched.",

Such an empty film outside of two or three scenes and a ton of wasted potential. I understand it was his son's directorial debut but I just expected more.",
      "Our tastes clearly differ in some respects, so YMMV, but somehow apparently neither of my favourite films so far this year (*caveat*: have not yet seen Sentimental Value, Hamnet or Marty Supreme) were among your 290.\n\nI highly recommend both The Kingdom (Le Royaume), a Corsican gangster movie from the perspective of a mob boss's teenage daughter, and The Sun Rises on US All, a Chinese drama about a woman whose ex unexpectedly resurfaces in her life – I don't think it's had a general release, but it was at TIFF. ",

I spent a year avoiding trailers/discussion threads/recaps/Wiki plot synopses and my movie-going experience improved dramatically. We've lost surprise nowadays. There are so many moments that would've landed like a nuclear strike if I hadn't already seen them in trailers over the years, I highly recommend this strategy to people. It can be difficult to avoid spoilers, but it's not impossible.",
      "I'm the same way, I avoid trailers whenever I can. Depending on the chain, I'll show up 10-20 minutes past showtime so I can skip as many trailers as possible. Other than a synopsis and knowing who's involved, I go in as blind as possible to every movie.",

It's like a 6/10 movie at best, with one or *maybe* two incredible sequences saving basically the entire thing from being a total disaster.\n\n(OP also gives Jurassic World Rebirth a 7/10, and it's probably the worst film I saw this year, so I'm guessing this list is not going to be particularly helpful for me...)",
      "Agreed, the whole Entity storyline is colossally stupid, Gabriel is the biggest nothingburger villain I've seen in a long time, and the guy got two whole movies! The writing is clunky as all hell. The submarine and plane sequences are good but far too much of the movie is just plain bad.",

      "One thing I’ve not heard much about is the average time an underperforming movie will stay in theaters. I love going to the movies and I don’t ever really watch big franchise movies. It can be tough, because most movies disappear after one week. Maybe it’s always been that way, but nevertheless.",
      "I feel like good movies used to be able to build box office numbers based on word of mouth and reviews, even growing distribution over time. It seems like movies get a tiny window in theaters now. Of course, you have to make a movie that’s actually good— that might be the problem with many of the movies listed here that I’ve never heard of.",
      "The first How to Train Your Dragon was shaping up to be a straight-up flop but got saved by word of mouth and had extended legs over time. \n\nImagine if they'd pulled it after it made less than half its budget back in 2 weeks instead of letting it ride. A multi-billion dollar franchise (multiple sequels, cross-media, and an entire amusement park) shot in the head before it even had a chance.",
      "A more recent example is Elemental. It eventually made a profit through long legs and positive word of mouth after a disastrous opening. It also did very well in the international market, better than its competitor Across Spider-verse in countries like South Korea.",

      "This isn't a problem if you hire and promote based on competency instead of connections.

They have no idea how regular people— their audiences— communicate.",

      "It’s always felt weird to me how opening weekend numbers were associated with how good a movie is. Surely that’s mostly a function of marketing and IP strength, right? A movie’s longevity in the theaters as more people actually experience it would be a better metric for quality.",
      "Yes. It actually says right in the article that a big release requires a big ad push. None of the movies listed did that; no one was going on youtube or facebook or Insta and repeatedly seeing any of these.\n\nContrast that with that dreadful Sidney Sweeny-Glen Powell thing last year which was on every fucking website, app and social media site, with her in a bikini.

      "Lack of time to see a film definitely hurts. There have been several I have missed because it was only around for one week.",
      "I think there’s less incentive for them to keep it in theaters because it cost more and they can just move it to streaming immediately. They used to have no choice but to leave them in theaters because it’s not like it was gonna show up in anybody’s home for six months at least.",
      "Yeah. I have a couple of 70mm theaters near me, and I wanted to go see *The Brutalist* but couldn't make the opening weekend. Except by the second weekend, there were no more 70mm showings of it at either of the theaters near me. They canned it completely after the first weekend and used the screens they had that could handle 70mm and were using them for regular showings. AFAIK, the only reconfiguration between 70mm and 35mm for these theaters was just curtain positioning, And the curtains are electronically controlled so they can just switch between the two formats quickly.\n\nI get that 70mm is even more specialized than IMAX and has an even smaller following, but still: one weekend only? I suspect the problem is a mixture of studios being very risk adverse, too sensitive to let something ride for a bit of it's not an immediate smash success, but I think another post of the proven is theaters are so sensitive to empty seats that they simply can't tolerate a film that isn't pulling people in at any given showing.",
      "I've been noticing this too.  I really want to see Warfare, I didn't get a chance to go over the weekend though, and now that I'm looking up times to go this weekend it's already out of every theater near me.  I have to go before wednesday or just wait for it to be out on disc because I'm not watching an A24/Garland movie on shitty streaming audio.  It's like they're not even giving some of these movies a chance.",

So it means I'm less likely to find a movie to watch, which means I'm not building up my habit of going to see movies. They need to keep movies off streaming platforms for longer to keep more choices in theaters longer, to build back the habits of feeling like I need to go to a theater to see a movie. Additionally, this SHOULD mean theaters make more money so they don't have to bump up ticket/concession prices so much either.",

Theaters can't stay open when they run too many empty shows. But I think maybe giving some of the less popular movies ONE showing a week for a few more weeks, rather than none, could be a good way to keep up a good variety and get more out of each movie made.",

      "Absolutely agreed on not building up a habit of going to see movies. \n\nMy wife and I, like many people, stopped going to movies for the first two years of the pandemic. Then we had a kid, which meant mostly the end of our social life for a while. When we finally got some breathing room and had the occasional night free when someone else could watch the kid, we’d check out the local movie theaters and there would be so few movies playing. And any exciting movie that we had been hearing about that we had missed the opening weekend two weeks ago was already gone. \n\nSo we’ve mostly stopped even thinking about going to movies on “date nights” anymore.",

This post is literally the first time I've heard of most of these movies. \n\nIt doesn't matter how original or good a movie is if nobody knows it's out there to be seen, and with theater attendance generally down, walk-in attendance from just showing up and seeing the poster isn't a reliable way to get people in seats.",

Last weekend didn't work out because of other commitments interfering with the two showtimes available to us. (We're 50, we're not going to a 10:45 showing.)\n\nThis weekend? Nothing. Three weeks in the movie's gone and now we'll just catch it on streaming later. \n\nHowever, Minecraft had about 25 showings a day. Repeat this cycle for many, many movies.",

      "That could be considered a Visa or MasterCard rules violation. Generally, convenience fees should only be applied to payments made outside of a merchant's normal payment channel. If they don't have a way to avoid the fee, they could get fined by the card brands. It's different if it's just a surcharge applied regardless of payment channel. At which point they shouldn't be calling it a convenience fee.",

Is it as a good as a theater? No, but it's also not a 20-30 inch CRT at 240p with 2 tinny speakers.  \n\nAlso fuck ads.  Every time I go to the theater before we even get previews we get 5-10 minutes of straight ads after spending $15-30 on a ticket.  Fuck that.\n\nSimilar to the console to arcade analogy, you'll never replace a full scale Daytona or After Burner cabinet, but that's a unique experience.

Something changed in our collective psyche around when the internet became accessible to everyone with smartphones between 2011 and 2015. \n\n\nBefore then, a lot of the internet felt like stumbling through isolated pockets of people huddled in a sea of dark. A mysterious new frontier where anything was maybe possible, certainly man-made horrors like serial killers, cartel mutilations, and harmful sadomasochism, so why not ghosts and demons, too? Pre-human civilizations, aliens, government spooks, voices in the woods. It felt like telling stories around a campfire.\n\n\n\nAnd just like that, there was a suspension of disbelief, where your sober mind didn't believe these things, of course, but huddled around your monitor at 2am when the wind was blowing, Ted The Caver seemed real. \n\n\nThe Blair Witch is a similar campfire story. It's not scary in the bright of day. And people's attention spans are shot so it seems slow. But as someone that camped a lot as a kid in woods just like that?

He doesn't have a franchise, so he's never been locked in with a long term character. \n\nThe comparisons to Tom Cruise are valid, but where Cruise has leaned harder into action and more mass appeal films, Pitt has a more diverse mix, especially post 2010.\n\nEdit: I blanked on the Oceans movies.

So in total, in 2024, WB in America distributed 9 and a half (Twisters is half) movies in 2024 that got wide theatrical releases, only 3 and a half of them could be called hits. Technically calling Twisters a hit is also maybe a stretch, it was huge in America but not globally. \n\n2025, WB America has distributed 7 seven films, they started off rough with Companion which did just fine, Mickey 17 was a bomb, and Alto Knights was a bomb both ways but since Minecraft, it’s been box office hit after box office hit. I wonder how long it’s gonna go for and what film will be the one that breaks the streak. I unfortunately think One Battle After Another will be the one… Superman’s gonna be a success no doubt, Weapons relies on word of mouth/marketing, it’s budget is low enough that 150 million ww would make it a hit.

He could’ve tried to disguise it, but it was wide open over the radio with his team, that any official would easily know. \n\nBack in 2008 a car crashed on purpose to benefit a teammate on the way to him winning the race. It was a huge scandal. \n\nA back marker team who has never scored a point doesn’t overnight become competitive in a span of 9 races by shaving a couple tenths off a lap time either. Other teams would follow suit almost immediately if a part was *that* advantageous. \n\nBoth are very far fetched scenarios in the world of F1, but I’m going to watch a movie where dinosaurs come back to life next week so it’s perfectly okay to include as plot devices for entertainment sake. Not knocking them for that.",

The man is an F1 terrorist. I really can’t even cover in this comment all the illegal things he did in this movie. \n\nIntentionally causing a safety car or red flag for strategy purposes is a HUGE no-no. Google Singapore GP 2008 for an example of the mess it causes. \n\nA new team like APX GP not being able to score points in its first few seasons is completely normal and expected, and expecting that team to suddenly compete for wins overnight is lunacy. Haas F1 joined the grid in 2016 and still isn’t close to hoping for a win. Cadillac is joining next  season and isn’t hoping to compete for wins until 2030 at best. \n\nThe movie just does not care at all about when or why Safety Cars or Red Flags are declared. \n\nThe premise itself of a driver coming back after 30 years away is obviously ridiculous. And doing so with no prep on top of that? Competing physically in F1 requires physical prep that even active drivers of other racing leagues would struggle with. \n\nThe movie doesn’t acknowledge the practice sessions that happen before races, and barely acknowledges qualifying. Drivers don’t just show up on Sunday and race. The race weekend starts for them on Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nObviously, the actual racing maneuvers and pace differences are complete nonsense. \n\n“They’ve got us beat in the straights, but we can fight in the turns” …it is SO much harder to be faster in the turns  than on the straights. In fact, it used to be very common for struggling and underfunded F1 teams to intentionally reduce their downforce in turns to gain more speed on the straights. It’s cheap and easy to do\n\nThe movie starts with the 24hrs of Daytona and then Sonny leaves that to join F1 9 races into the F1 season. But the 24hrs of Daytona actually happens in January, usually about a month or two before the F1 season starts. \n\nAnd more…",

      "What do you mean no prep they ran around the track as a team",
      "Nobody would watch this movie if the races were 100% realistic. Not even F1 fans, they would rather just watch some actual real races instead.",

      "Yeah. Kerry’s “He’s flying” delivery actually choked me up, which I didn’t expect. \n\nIt was all so cheesy and tropey and predictable, but man did it work. \n\nVery Top Gun Maverick. The new “subverting expectations” is just delivering satisfying payoffs, even if they are expected.",

He had to have a lot of luck in order to get there.",

It was what I imagine live action Cars or Days of Thunder sequel would be like\n- The quickly addressed why Sonny Hayes (at his age) would be a F1 driver and making his experience a focal point of the movie \n- The movie is a lot funnier than expected. Using loopholes to close gaps and winning the races is an interesting angle for a main protagonist\n- Brad Pitt easily carries this movie with his charisma but Kerry Condon steals the movie for me. I'm glad that she used her actual accent for the movie\n- Damson Idris is good in the movie but slightly underdeveloped. It may be due to Simone Ashley's role being cut which lessened his characterization. Also, cutting Simone Ashley but only showing one frame of her during the British Grand Prix is kinda diabolical. \n- The racing scenes are exhilarating. It is basically like Top Gun Maverick but with cars. The editing in those racing scenes is excellent and easily should be the frontrunner for an Oscar. \n- Only drawback of the movie was the music for me. There were too many needle drops instead of actual score. \n- The final 3-lap sprint with the double sacrifice is one of my favourite endings.\n\nIt may be a huge marketing movie for F1 but it has a lot of heart and filmmaking precision!",

Not to mention the \"built for combat\" shtick lol. \n\nBut, the camera work was fantastic. I felt like I was in the car while the racing scenes were happening.

      "&gt;Lights out - and away they go! [#F1TheMovie](https://youtu.be/n-MDGqexqjQ?si=fVwXSFB17Zjyju4K) only in theaters June 27. https://apple.co/_F1​\n\n&gt;From Apple Original Films and the filmmakers from Top Gun: Maverick comes the high-octane, action-packed feature film F1, starring Brad Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski.  The film is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Kosinski, seven-time FORMULA 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner and Chad Oman.\n\n&gt;Dubbed “the greatest that never was,” Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) was FORMULA 1’s most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career.  Thirty years later, he’s a nomadic racer-for-hire when he’s approached by his former teammate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), owner of a struggling FORMULA 1 team that is on the verge of collapse.  Ruben convinces Sonny to come back to FORMULA 1 for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world.  He’ll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace.  But as the engines roar, Sonny’s past catches up with him and he finds that in FORMULA 1, your teammate is your fiercest competition—and the road to redemption is not something you can travel alone.\n\n&gt;F1 also stars Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, Kim Bodnia, and Javier Bardem, and has been shot during actual Grand Prix weekends as the team competes against the titans of the sport.\n\n&gt;Kosinski directs from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger.  The film is executive produced by Daniel Lupi.  Collaborating with Kosinski behind the scenes are his creative team, including director of photography Claudio Miranda, production designers Mark Tildesley and Ben Munro, editor Stephen Mirrione, costume designer Julian Day, casting director Lucy Bevan and composer Hans Zimmer.\n\n&gt;Apple Original Films Presents a Monolith Pictures / Jerry Bruckheimer / Plan B Entertainment / Dawn Apollo Films Production, A Film by Joseph Kosinski, F1, distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, in theaters and IMAX nationwide on June 27, 2025 and internationally beginning 25 June 2025.",

      "The average age of F1 drivers is 27 1/2. The casting is Hollywood perfect.",
      "The entire plot revolves around Pitt’s character being an old fart being brought back into racing. In no way are they trying to pass him off as a 30 year old.",
      "It'll be interesting to see if they \"Top Gun Maverick\" it and effectively go \"here's what you want to see, Brad Pitt is still the best driver despite being twice the age of everyone else\".",
      "Have you read the plot of the movie?",
      "Bruh, read the synopsis",
      "I mean, Hamilton is 40; Alonso is 43. There have been some drivers in history over 50 too.",
      "Not in recent years there hasn’t, F1 in the 1950s was basically amateur racing by comparison and there hasn’t been anyone 50+ for very long time.\n\nAlso Brad Pitt is in his 60s now.",
      "They can definitely pass Pitt off as someone roughly the same age as Alonso - which is what it sounds like they are trying to do. He is *supposed* to be older than everyone else, he is being pulled out of retirement to help the team grab some points, he isn't supposed to be in his mid-late 20s, he's supposed to be in his 40s at a minimum",
      "Yeah. And, like, he doesn't look 60 in this shot. It's fine. Actors playing superheros can't actually fly"

      "Disney having multiple high profile flops/bombs is going to counter the mega hits but I'm not sure it's going to be enough for them to make less profit than WB. We have to wait and see what the Zootopia budget is and how much it makes but Avatar and Zootopia will give them a ton of money along with the hundreds of millions from Lilo &amp; Stitch. I'm sure Freakier Friday is giving them lowee profits as well and maybe F4 with all those brand deals.",
      "Yup. Avatar and Zootopia might blow past 600m in profits by themselves.",
      "A lot of avatars money will be made in 2026 though right?",
      "Its still a 2025 movie",
      "Disney also doesn't get most of the money.",
      "Considering Avatar 3 and Zootopia 2 not so big budget and the estimated box office, I'm not sure. We'll see",
      "Zootopia 2 will bring a lot of profits this year, Avatar 3 however as it releases only one week and a half before the end of the year most of its profits will count for the next year",
      "Zootopia 2 will make an absolute fuck ton of profit. For reference this $600M profit combined is still less than Inside Out 2's $650M profit.",
      "I'm glad for them. They were taking so many L's in the public eye the past few years. Hopefully, this is some course correcting that they're on. ",
      "I'm surprised that Sinners profits are pretty close to Weapons and Final Destination. I thought the big budget difference would make it a bigger gap but I guess the domestic over performance was really helpful for that. Very nice.",
      "Larger budget and Coogler got day one backend.",
      "I'm saying I thought the other films would have made a lot more profit given the bigger budget and backend deal, not that I thought Sinners would make a lot more than them",
      "Did Coogler get a cut?",
      "Yes he has some backend deal so I'd imagine that took about 30 million or so off the profit margin",
      "Which makes the profits even crazier to think about. It was likely pushing 100 mill in profits by itself and with the split it still was putting good money in the bank for WB.",
      "Sinners has the biggest budget at $90M",
      "Coogler made 20 to 30  million off Sinners and owns the rights",

      "&gt;Sinners, Weapons, F1 and Superman are all among my favorites of the year.\n\nThose are genuinely my Top 4 movies lmao with Mickey17 and Companion both at Top 10 as well.\n\nWB knocked it out of the park in 2025.",
      "They really did. And regardless of how One Battle turns out at the box office, I’m sure it’ll be a great movie to end their year on quality-wise.",

      "I know WB got shit on quite a bit the last couple of years, but they had quite a few hits with some major bombs sprinkled in. I mean, Barbie was the highest grossing movie of 2023, they had Wonka, Beetlejuice, GvK, Dune 2 as well. \n\nHonestly, it was mostly their DC stuff that bombed and were panned. ",
      "Not counting DC stuff:\n\n2023: house party ?, Magic Mike last dance did not break even, Evil dead rise was a big hit, Barbie highest grossing movie of the year, Meg 2 broke even, Nun 2 big financial hit with mixed reviews, Wonka massive hit, color purple underperformed, 4 of those 8 were for sure financial hits but the 4 DC movies that year take a toll on that. \n\n2024: dune part 2 massive hit, Godzilla X Kong financial hit, furiosa massive bomb unfortunately, watchers underperform, horizon a flop, co distribution on twisters which was kind of a hit, Trap breaks even, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice massive hit, juror no 2 limited release so that don’t count, war of the Rohirrim flop. \n\nSo not counting Juror No 2 and also not Joker 2, that’s 9 movies there and like 3 hits there.",
      "Yeah I missed some smaller flops/disappointments besides Furiosa, but my point was that it wasn’t like they had truly atrocious years. ",

With Weapons, Bloodlines and now Last Rites for the re-separated New Line and Sinners for WB that’s pretty impressive (add Companion and it feels as the executives decided to put NL back at its roots for mid budget horror and its succeeding).",

      "I agree that Rebirth and F1 doing stronger than expected has diverted audiences away from Superman, but both movies have stars (Scarlett Johanson and Mahershela Ali in Rebirth, Brad Pitt and Javier Bardem in F1) bigger - and more likely to get bums on seats - than any credited cast member in Superman 2025…\n\nAlso, Kevin Costner is an Oscar Winner and Amy Adams has been constantly nominated, so of course international audiences would know them on some level…",
      "So is the world a bit indifferent to Superman now, or to things USA-related?\n\nBoth?",
      "I think that's having more of an impact than people like to admit. The White House sent out an official communication using Trump in place of Superman on the poster for god's sake. That's basically equating the character with the actions of the US government. \n\nYes it's not intended by the filmmakers but things like that are just a reminder that Superman is a symbol of America and a *lot* of people hate America at the moment.",
      "Certainly the last thing James Gunn wanted to see the day they released the poster, that's for sure. I'm not saying that specific poster swayed anyone away from seeing the film, but it was definitely not the kind of sponsorship they were looking for lol\n\nI understand the comics have recently distanced themselves from the 'and the American way' ra-ra patriotism of the past, but for a good portion of the world who doesn't follow this stuff - Superman=USA",
      "I just think it's difficult to enjoy an inspirational immigrant story when our government is literally putting people into concentration camps.",
      "That's literally what the movie is about. Lex Luthor literally has his own black site where he's dumping people he illegally abducted. Superman isn't being portrayed as an inspirational immigrant story in spite of current events, he's portrayed that way as a direct response to what's happening in the world",
      "The film is pretty much a heavy critique on the trump administration and tech bros",
      "I agree (for the record I loved the film and have tickets to see it again) but you won't know that until you watch it. \n\nI hope the word of mouth will kick in but the movie might be in trouble with F4 releasing soon.",
      "Honestly, I don't see F4 doing gangbusters either given how soft anything Marvel related has been doing lately with Deadpool &amp; Wolverine being the only exception. There hasn't been major buzz on F4 except for a few online spots and the last live action take on it bombed. \n\nI hope it does well. I am going to see it. But I won't be shocked if it under performs. The story is going to have to be beyond good to bring in people by word of mouth. Look at Thunderbolts. The word of mouth was fantastic and it still ended up in the red. (And that one hurt because Thunderbolts is turning out to be my favorite movie this year thus far.)",
      "As much as the movie lines up with Trump stuff, it was also written in 2022, and shot a bit later, well before the current Trump admin. So while it probably works... It was probably coincidental. \n\nLex Luthor, however, has definitely been a critique of technocrat billionaires for many years in his comic book depictions.",
      "This is literally the first time I've heard about this. If anything, you're the one overestimating how chronically online most people are.",
      "It could be lack of star power.   Jurassic has Scarjo and dinosaurs.  F1 has Brad Pitt and Lewis Hamilton and F1 cars.  Captain America had Harrison Ford and Red Hulk.  An all American Superman was never as big a draw as Spidey with his quips and Batman with his Gothic inner turmoil.  Mrs Meisel doesn't fill seats in China.\n\nThe marketing campaign has missed the mark overseas.  Launching into a crowded market hurt, especially when Imax screens are a huge source of overseas revenue and people wanted dinosaurs on those screens.\n\nIt could get some legs with belated Imax screenings or when people have seen the other movies and get around to this one.",
      "I think there's a lot of anti-American sentiment wrapped up in a lot of the international performance, especially in Asia. Mostly because it's not just Superman experiencing it. The international market has been consistently soft since Covid for almost every American blockbuster, save for a handful of major exceptions. China in particular is a market that's absolutely cratered when it comes to US blockbusters. \n\nAnd to be honest, as a US citizen, I can't really blame the rest of the world for being down on my country and any of our shit right now.",
      "You're right, this sentiment has already been growing over the past few years, and with Superman's origin being tied to the USA so much (despite it not *meaning to be*), I think a lot of people look at that and say no thank you.",
      "I think the Mission Impossible movies are a good illustrator of things, actually. If you look at the Mission Impossible franchise trend line you'll see that, for the most part, the international performance trended upward from 1996 until 2018 while the domestic performance largely stayed consistently within the same range. Then in 2023 the international numbers crater, and most of that can be attributed to the Chinese boxoffice returns.",
      "I don’t think Superman has ever had the international draw that Batman or spiderman has, I don’t think it’s very surprising",
      "I think it's more the US stuff. \n\nI watched superman and loved it in the UK because the story was great. But I think a lot of people skipped out based on superman being seen as corny and also it representing America even though the story was a very interesting one",
      "I mean it still made 80 million dollars which isn’t a small number. DC has a decade of reputational damage to fix and it’s going to take a couple of good movies to get back on track.",
      "American related for sure. People want nothing to do with the US anymore",
      "It's more about the general superhero movie fatigue, the superman actor being unconvincing at first glance and, at least for Europe, some people not caring at all for Hollywood productions trying to lecture them on immigration.",

      "Includes both",

      "I didn't know what that as but stumbled on a youtube short somehow in my feed the other day and that was enough to go \"okay...these performances look interesting.\"",
      "I read the script and wow, it's really interesting. So I think it's a worthy drive. Good movie",
      "&gt;Now obviously, there's the question: could it have debuted higher? Perhaps, yeah. But as mentioned, DC's brand is at an all-time low and they're currently struggling to gain good will with the audience. ***Superman*** is the first step in building that good will. After all, the character has had very rough decades; the Christopher Reeve films fizzled out by the end, ***Superman Returns*** disappointed\\*\\*\\*, and the DCEU Superman didn't fully connect with audiences.\n\nThis is why I think the success of DC is doomed to not be as durable as Warners might hope: it will take a run of several films to establish good-will, wash the bad taste of the previous iteration, get out from under the shadow of Marvel AND get up to speed and only then they might afford to rest on their laurels a little, were it not for the fact that by that time, the overall superhero fatigue may get to such a pitch as to render the entire endeavour anachronistic.\n\nIn the short run, however, the success of this film - following those of Final Destination, Sinners and Minecraft, and the corporate bloodletting that preceded it all - will help keep the struggling juggernaut afloat and give a quieter home front to other, hopefully more interesting projects at work in New Line Cinema and elsewhere under the Warners flag.",

      "What Marvel did in that run really is incredible. 23 films over 11 years. The only film under 400 million was the first Captain America (I'm discounting The Incredible Hulk which was 265, but I can understand if you want to include it.) 9 movies over 1 billion. 2 over 2 billion and a third at 1.5 billion. \n\nAbsolutely incredible honestly. The additional fact that none of the movies were terrible is wild, sure there were some sub par ones like Thor 2, but still a fine popcorn flick. And then finally at the end of the day they managed to tell an overarching story in that time period as well.\n\nI kinda think that's the big thing missing from Marvel right now. Maybe DCU can do that, but like others have said in this thread, its gonna take a few movies just for everyone to be game for it in the first place. So, anyways, we'll see what happens.

But if you look back, there's been superhero movies as a constant mainstay of cinema since well before Iron Man launched the MCU. There just obviously aren't as many as there are now.\n\nI think the main thing people might be getting tired of is just how sanitized, corporate, and safe Marvel feels now. The world is full of real problems that blockbuster cinema is usually unwilling to touch.

I'll leave you with this:\n\nThe subject matter of the new Superman movie is pretty dark. It tackles real, current, modern day issues but transposes them into the absurdity that are comic books. This really felt like a movie made for *today*, not a movie made in the pretend version of America that Hollywood likes to pretend still exists. It's not really something you can understand without seeing the movie.\n\nJust because a movie has jokes doesn't mean it can't also be handling tough subject matter in a genuine way. As someone who's been through a lot of shit in my life, humor is sometimes the only thing to get you through the day. It's *how* that humor is handled which can make something tasteful or absurd. There was no irreverent humor in the new Superman. That's all I can say.",

I think a big reason Superman is resonating right now is because the news has just been a firehose of bullshit for the last ten years or so, with the worst people this country has to offer running roughshod over their opposition and doing whatever the hell they want.

James Cameron is the only one who's figured out how to make actually super popular movies everywhere with any reliability. \n\nThen there's China which [still only lets 25% of the money](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/hollywood-chinese-box-office-trump-tariffs.html) leave the country. Unless you can swing a co-production which far as I can tell is no rubber stamp and last I heard still only raised things to 37% I think.

Just looking at the film, it's obviously a lot more expensive and there's plenty of room for both hefty profits and cost increases in those numbers. There should be an unreported on greek tax credit that gives more details on true spending but it wasn't trivially easy to find (I'd need to know the local production entity) so I gave up.\n\n\nSimilarly, we can look at Knives Out 3 and see that part way through filming RJ paid himself $25M pounds to write and direct while Bergman is paid $15M pounds to produce. That's already over $40M *before* making the film or accounting for Craig's salary. Director salary, producer fees, Craig's Salary, etc. are all real costs the film needs to incur. \n\nThose are real \"insane\" costs for a midbudget murder mystery film...except they're not insane because these costs are a reflection of Netflix's purchase price so it's basically profit sharing.

Jolie’s lawyer states the dispute started when Pitt accused her of being “too deferential” to their kids. The two started fighting in the plane’s bathroom.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; “Pitt grabbed Jolie by the head and shook her, and then grabbed her shoulders and shook her again before pushing her into the bathroom wall,” the countersuit reads. “Pitt then punched the ceiling of the plane numerous times, prompting Jolie to leave the bathroom.”\n\n\n\n&gt; The countersuit states that Pitt attempted to get physical with one of their kids after the child came to Jolie’s defense.\n\n\n\n&gt; “When one of the children verbally defended Jolie, Pitt lunged at his own child and Jolie grabbed him from behind to stop him,” the countersuit states. “To get Jolie off his back, Pitt threw himself backwards into the airplane’s seats injuring Jolie’s back and elbow. The children rushed in and all bravely tried to protect each other. Before it was over, Pitt choked one of the children and struck another in the face. Some of the children pleaded with Pitt to stop. They were all frightened. Many were crying.”\n\n\n&gt; Jolie “arranged for separate transportation at the airport” to bring her and the children to a hotel without Pitt, the suit continues. “She then went to wake Pitt up and told him that she and the children were going to a hotel. Pitt once again screamed at her, and pushed her down yet again.”\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://variety.com/2022/film/news/angelina-jolie-accuses-brad-pitt-abuse-choking-kids-1235393010/\n\n\n\n\nThis NPR article goes into more detail about him pouring alcohol on his wife and kids on the plane.\n\n\n\n https://www.npr.org/2022/10/05/1126925040/brad-pitt-choked-and-his-children-angelina-jolie-says-in-a-court-filing\n\n\n&gt; As reported in August, Jolie was behind an anonymous 2016 lawsuit in which the plaintiff alleged being assaulted by her “then-husband” on a private plane. The actor told an FBI agent that Pitt “physically and verbally assaulted” her and their children, and the agent went on to meet with the assistant U.S. attorney. The agent concluded they would not pursue criminal charges, causing Jolie to anonymously file a Freedom of Information Act suit against the FBI in order to obtain documents related to the federal investigation against Pitt.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; In the new countersuit, Jolie’s lawyer states that the FBI agent who investigated the allegations had “concluded that the government had probable cause to charge Pitt with a federal crime for his conduct that day.”",
