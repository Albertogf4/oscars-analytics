      "It's clear from the comments why the right has produced very little worthwhile art. They have no imagination and take everything literally. They think every piece of art is an instruction manual.",

      "Masterpiece and instant classic. 🎉",
      "The entire film is a work of art of the highest Calibur.",

      "total anti-White trash",
      "Just a point of view. Thiught the audio was dreadful. The music drowned out the movie audio.",
      "Looks like a bunch of Chinese bots commenting to boost the movie.  I guess I'm supposed to watch this movie, grab my 9mm and go out and start killing politicians.  Is that what the purpose of the movie is ?  And when I go out and do the dirty work, are the producers and actors going to be right behind me or are they going to be on a yacht somewhere watching the news and laughing saying what an idiot I was to get inspired by this movie.  When the body count adds up I will ask the actors then what they thought would happen.",
      "This Woke Anti American movie got me loading up on Ammo and heading to the range.  I thought they would have learned their lesson after \"the purge\", and when they inspire the Left Wing fanatics to take up arms they will be responsible for the blood bath that follows.",
      "The only lead actor here is Sean Penn! Hope he wins the Oscar, this guy is a legend! Leo only played second fiddle to him in this movie.",
      "Weird that the only negative opinions I have seen have been for purely political reasons. Almost like the movie is too good to criticize on its own.",
      "DiCaprio doesn't seem to understand that they deliberately want to pull whites through the cocoa. Strange trash.",
      "What an amazing movie and actors ❤",
      "Sean Penn was brilliant",
      "Wait but didn’t the guy Leo is playing just get laid out by ICE?!? This shld be categorized as a comedic fairytale drama, it’s certainly no mystery or thriller. Sorry Leo.",
      "A masterpiece of stupidity ✨️✨️✨️✨️ w o w",
      "Looks like a film to stoke Woke revolutionaries against the evil facist Trump admin. We are now being played by Hollywood too folks. They want violence to usher in the NWO surveillance state.",
      "Great Movie!",
      "Sean Penn deserves an oscar for that performance..",
      "One of the worst movies  ever",
      "Didn't make it 10 minutes and decided to turn it off.  Deleted the garbage from my PC. Very glad I didn't pay a single dollar for this garbage.",

      "One of the most important movies",
      "I think someone should make a spin adult animated serious about Bob Ferguson because the character is a trip",
      "This a very good movie something new something very thrilling",
      "DiCaprio never disappoints.  Penn was an off the chart bad guy.  I just watched this gem of a movie and I'm all worked up.  Where did they find that road with the all the ups and downs?  Cinematography, score, all the actors, love, love this flick!",
      "This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. So unrealistic.",
      "Absolute rubbish.",
      "Excellent movie and acting",
      "Completely rubbish. Glorifying violent lefties. Boring as h3ll",
      "So many anti-“woke” sheep frothing at the mouth over this obvious satirical film calling it anti-white race-mixing liberal propaganda because they’re overly sensitive 💀",
      "Must see f-ing movie. Sean Penn killed his role and if you haven't seen it, you'll see a side to him never displayed before. I don't have a freaking clue where that character came up from, but his walk and jaw movements deserves an Oscar alone. Lol. Nah, like really!!!! Lol",
      "a dreadful film ,,all over thge place hateful characters and just a mess from start to finish woke garbage anti USA anti Gov anti Trump movie they them woke BS  if this gets an oscar then it truly is proof that oscars are marketing bs to just self gratify themselfs and to get dumbos to go watch there garagbage movies ...de caprio can do so much better and should learn to stick with movies like the DEPARTED before we all end up departing him as an actor of any merit",

      "Be careful if you have an emotionally distant father that finds unique ways to tell you that he loves you. Why does this movie have me all messed up?!",
      "What is this rubbish? The storyline of Cars 4 was much more appealing.",
      "Watched it today.. thought it was gonna be a good movie \n\nJust a leftist wet dream of attacking immigration detention camps that have 0 security and there all sleeping on the job blowing up the electrical grid and blowing up campaign offices and robbing federal buildings",
      "San Franciscans and Californians as a whole have seen what the result of Socialist Democrat policies are. We have been watching them FAIL for decades.\r\n\r\nBroken Auto glass everywhere, feces on the sidewalk, tents on the sidewalk, syringes on the ground and open air drug use/sales, open air stolen goods markets on the sidewalk in San Francisco, locked up basic items like toothpaste, batteries, deodorant in our stores requiring help from employees of the store just to buy, businesses fleeing, flash mobs robbing stores, gangs everywhere, and law abiding citizens being denied our 2nd amendment rights, etc.\r\n\r\nIf anyone likes to live under these conditions, then vote Democrat and you will get these conditions to live under.\r\n\r\nTrust me, it is very undesirable if you value, your safety and your personal property and just general and law and order. \r\n\r\nGod Bless America\r\n\r\nMake California America Again. \r\n\r\nVote for Chad Bianco in 2026",
      "Hollywood priming us for the Civil War that the Globalist \"Elites\" seem to desire.",
      "The song used in this trailer is an edited version of ocean waves correct? Crazy they didnt even want to spoil the score for this, best film of the 2020's no question",
      "Last months of pregnancy and shes moving like that and even shooting with LMG. Yep, thanks but no.",
      "Cel mai slab film cu Di.Caprio",
      "This does not look good at all 😅",
      "Total BS",
      "PTA worse movie 👎 Nope!\nBots and straight liars in the comments 😂 1 or 2 funny scenes, but nope. Sean Penn is good. This is more of a mockery. It's a satire, but it isn't done very well.",
      "wasn't that great",
      "I guess Teyana redeemed herself after Straw",
      "Complete trash",
      "Saw this yesterday on streaming, waiting out a winter snowstorm.❄️ Totally want to watch it again! There are few actors worth the price of admission to a movie theater and Leo is one of them, Tom being another.",
      "It was ok movie wouldn't say great sean penn character was weird I liked second half of movie better then first half when there coming after all them.",
      "Warner Bros really going all out with these bot comments. You can just look at the like-to-dislike ratio to get an idea of what people really thought of this film. Go woke, go broke. This is why it's lost 100 million in revenue.",
      "Dad Leo before GTA 6",
      "WB had the two highest nominated movies at the Oscars this year.\n\nNow they’re getting sold to Netflix, where they’ll have the s***iest theatrical releases in cinematic history.\n\nHollywood has lost their way. Too many MBAs at the heads of the table and not enough people with actual love for the industry.",
      "Just saw this on TV, what was the point of making this movie? 😂",
      "What time is it?",
      "Cringey and dated like the book.",
      "This is an attempt to create an anti-white world. It's an attempt to brainwash whites into thinking they need to help blacks and be an assistant sidekick. Reject this garbage",
      "Lost me in the first 5 minutes. Sean Penn used to be my hero.",
      "Absolute garbage, don’t waste your time.",
      "A very important and good movie against ICE actually, and highly political and relevant. Taylor Swift saw it and liked it too, by the way. And the reason why Trump has allowed Paramount to aggressively pursue buying Warner Bros, because he hates this movie and wants to install a new CEO in your studio loyal to his agenda. See, I know everything what's going on behind the scenes in Hollywood these days. Tell the current CEOs of Warner Bros that I'm with them on this film. Resist the new pro-Trump CEO of Paramount, and stay independent from the US government's influence. This is important for all filmmakers, because the trumpers of this world are trying to take over our entertainment industry aswell. Man, I don't even know if this comment of mine will show up here or be ghosted by youtube, that's how heated this is actually. You can even tell by the negative feedback in this commentary section.",
      "This movie is just anti-imperialist propaganda, nothing more HAHAha",
      "I watched it with high hopes. \nIt wasnt very good LOL.",
      "This movie is completely worthless. A bunch of symbolism in a bottomless movie. Hollywood has had one message for the past few years that is very evident in this movie and that message is \"The Age of Aquarius has arrived, the tyrannical, militaristic American government has come to an end, and the third bad message is that America will probably be destroyed by an angry and protesting people.\"",
      "What about USA? 😮",
      "What happened to Rhianna’s face, is it a Hollywood make-up disguise or is she transitioning to a man? Anyone know?",
      "propaganda movie for low IQ individuals so they can feel superior. Utter goyslop",
      "Goyslop at its finest. Enjoy gluttons! Hope it wins all the Oscar’s.",
      "what a garbage",
      "Viva la revolución!\nEvery lives has an oath words 🎉🎉🎉",
      "The first 10 minutes was too corny for me to get past",
      "Am I the only one to be underwhelmed by this critically appraised film? It had its moments, but only saving grace was Sean Penn & distinct soundtrack.",
      "Good movie. It really rolled until the last hour: when a lot of the action went down is when it started to drag. I don't have anything to say which meant it worked in its own right...except when it started to lag. The last hour needed an edit to keep the whole thing snappy like the start. A little dark, but their personal strength and vision were united. I really enjoyed some of these characters, even deCaprio, and I never like deCaprio. The 'regular' kids were awesome in their clips. The film could have had more of that, how the 3rd parties reacted. In film the best moments are others' reactions, like when the dolphins breached in the Big Blue. The high school kids' non-acting acting was a thing of beauty. Juxtaposing that with Sean Penn's gross character which was just over the top weird. I'm not saying that the state actors aren't degenerates, but that sociopathic narcissism is also a blind spot, not a Bond supervillain.",
      "I miss seeing Benecio in movies",
      "\"...to umí každej debil...\" 😆😁😄\n\nJediné čo si z \"tohto\" (2025/+ motákov), Katka, ber, aby si sa mi neplietla do života/do minulosti, aby, ak chceš aby sme sa častejšie vídali, som nemal pri tebe zbytočne veľa negatívnych trigger moments (ako prakticky VŠETCI v mojom živote na kom mi záležalo) - už beztak máš, čo vysvetlovať za 2022+2025 + tuším/tipujem, že si si ma teraz aj na mobile blokla, čiže už aj 2026.....(just FYI)\n\nCapish?

      "On Kalshi prediction market betting website, it has a 72 percent chance of winning an Oscar for best movie. Sinners is at 21 percent. What do ya'll think?",
      "After Oscar nominations who all came here to see here's the trailer",
      "Id watch this if he wasnt in a mixed race relationship. Calvin Candie would never date one of his workers.",
      "From the trailer, it seems to be pretty violent. Is that the case?",
      "Is this movie supposed to be about a left winged pipe dream? Or attempting to glorify movements like antifa? If the hope for the left's supposed fight against fascism is antifa and some social justice Hollywood movie, then there really isnt much hope for them at all is there? 😂",
      "I'm sorry Teyana Taylor cannot act. I just dont understand how she got an award???",
      "Here after oscar nominations",
      "Who is here after oscars",
      "白人就一定要配个黑老婆,日,好莱坞成天搞这些政治正确的傻逼玩意,不看了",
      "a lumpy boring film. DiCaprio works hard to keep it real. even Del Toro's presence can't lift this above the counter. i suppose it belongs to Penn's gruesome Lockjaw - which isn't the point, I assume? the comedy aspect of the film mire's the story's meaning - whatever that is?\nand it's nods to Scorsese & probably Kubrick, only make this bloated long-winder dull, uninspiring and not particularly original or interesting.",
      "Raz obejrzeć i zapomnieć.",
      "“One Battle After Another” is a decent movie it’s definitely worth a watch but I wouldn’t watch it again. The Sean Pen character Lockjaw is pretty absurd like a cartoon character almost. The Christmas Cult was absurd too. The only character I liked was Benicio Del Toro’s character. I also hope this movie doesn’t inspire a bunch of younger rebellious inclined girls to ruin their lives.",
      "One Battle After Another is nothing more than a bloated piece of liberal propaganda masquerading as high art, pushing a dangerous narrative that romanticizes left-wing violence and portrays conservatives as cartoonish fascist villains. Paul Thomas Anderson crafts a fever dream where washed-up radicals bombing buildings and resisting immigration enforcement are depicted as sympathetic underdogs fighting a white supremacist dystopia, ignoring the real-world consequences of such extremism. With Leonardo DiCaprio's sweaty, incompetent protagonist shouting revolutionary slogans while enabling chaos, the film feels like an apologia for Antifa-style terrorism, especially ill-timed amid recent political violence—it's irresponsible and could inspire more division rather than entertain. Skip this three-hour preach fest; it's not satire, it's insidious Hollywood bias at its worst, glorifying losers who waste lives on misguided \"resistance\" instead of productive citizenship. 0/10—save your money for films that don't hate half the country.",
      "Looks dumb",
      "This movie was SOOO good. Had me on the edge of my seat the entire time!!!",
      "Man yk what I gotta say this film is the best fricking film of 2025",
      "I just watched it on HBO. It's about 2 hrs and 45 minutes long. I thought \"I'll probably watch it in pieces\" since it's so long. Man, I watched that mf'er without so much as a pause. Just locked in. Bravo, everyone involved.",
      "This movie give liberal th failed idea they can do what they want with no consequences",

      "loved this movie",
      "Predictable Boring and about 40 minutes too long. Another over hyped flick.",
      "The film score is excellent.",
      "This was a HORRIBLE movie!!!",
      "ITS A MASTERPIECE! 10/10. go watch, you won’t regret",
      "The positive reviews have got to be shills.  The only thing entertaining about this film is how spectacularly bad it is.  Badly written, badly acted, zero plot.  I wondered if it was intended to be a spoof.",
      "Bad movie. Waste of time.",
      "This movie sucked 😂😂. The music is loud, never stops and is awful. The acting is decent but over all nope, won’t ever watch it again and don’t recommend it.",
      "After the Golden Globes, I wanted to see what the hype was about. \n\nI do think this is a Best Picture contender but Sean Penn should get Best Supporting Actor for Lockjaw. No doubt!\n\n Teyana could be nominated.",
      "This movie is actively supporting ANTIFA terrorism F U Leonardo",
      "Why is there a black person sign languaging to me on direct tv in the corner when I try to watch this movie. I’m not even joking",
      "What an epic flick! Just wrapped it up—those performances were inspired by some muse somewhere. That closing track, \"American Girl,\" hit me right in the feels and left me a little misty-eyed with pure nostalgia. Ended on such a perfect, bittersweet high.",
      "This movie will just encourage stupid people to make the biggest mistake of their stupid lives.",
      "What was that?",
      "Of course this comment section is an echo chamber for a horrific and horrible film that plays into the crumbling, historically ignorant ethos (pathos?) of our modern age. Regardless of \"good\" or \"bad\" acting, this movie is lionized as a bastion of and a pernicious nod to a romanticized, ridiculous iteration of \"revolutionaries\" and the hypostatic union of their raunchy, violent radicalism and haunting hypocrisy. One of the \"best films\" of 2025? Only if your functioning five senses are short-circuited by a creeping criminalism that coruscates across the dark, dismal regressive sky.",
      "Talk about Hollyweird doing everything possible to activate the weirdos in to doing violence. GG.",
      "Such a good director and awesome cast and everything.  Too bad the movie is woke.  What a waste.  PT Anderson should deport himself.",
      "Best movie of the year",
      "😱🤬😳🙄...😴",
      "Super racist white people vs super racist black people and their empathy minions.  Funny AF",
      "A truly revolting film with nothing to recommend it whatsoever",
      "Gosh Sinners was so good and this movie came out.",
      "they are lying this is so bad",
      "Some people would really glaze a movie just bacause a big director made it but the reality is the movie is an absolute flop. Except for being interesting to see what comes next it absolutely sucks!",
      "Watched the movie and I must say this was the first time I hated watching Leonardo Dicaprio on my screen, I detest his character",
      "watched the whole thing, possibly the dumbest movie ive ever watched, its so bad, i cant stop telling people about it, maybe that was the point.",
      "Amazing Movie one of the best movie.  That I have watch in a long time",
      "A brilliant film, go see it!",
      "I did not expect to like this movie at all, which is why I think I loved it even more. It was so surprising and just so funny without even trying to be funny. Leo is absolutely fantastic in this!",
      "Glad I didn't see this dumpster fire 🔥 the fact that they dehumanized Teyana Taylor over sexualizing her character just so white men in the movie can lust after her is disgusting just like they did Halle Berry in Monster's Ball",
      "Oh yay! A 3 hour movie where Hollywood lectures us about institutional racism and America is really a horrible authoritarian racist country? \nAnd they said Hollywood can’t change😂",
      "Is there someone who knows where to watch this mobie? Or free link",
      "What is this slop",
      "Ah, splendid the movie that shows how cowardly & conniving & full of deceit the average libtard is.\nKeep making movies that shows everyone how insane you all truly are.\n\nThis living witness of God finds it rather amusing to see you suffer unendingly.",
      "I wanted to like this film but it honestly sucked…I love Benecio Del Toro and Leonardo DiCaprio but this really fell short of the mark for me…way too long and the propaganda was ridiculous…we watch movies to be entertained so stick to that",
      "More of the same BS",
      "Imagine thinking Warner Bros offers rebellious ideas and that you're a rebel for agreeing with a 100 billion dollar company that has the greenlight to openly and freely produce films like this. WB has been political propaganda since WW2. Imagine thinking you're a rebel for wanting open borders when it's already being forced upon all of Europe. Political tools lol.",
      "There aren't anymore American actors loyal to the USA.  After watching this, I now know why the youth of America has become toxic and confused.",
      "Great acting by all .  I just didn’t enjoy the movie story line .😮",
      "Sean Penn- I would have watched it if not for him. Just adores himself",
      "Finally, an original film worth watching!",

      "This movie absolutely sucked! I was so excited to watch it and then after about 30 minutes or so I just got up and walked out out of the theater, and walk across the street to the IHOP for some crêpes. Truthfully, the crêpes what are the best part of the night and a way better financial decision than paying to watch that movie. Absolutely the worst movie I’ve ever seen Leonardo DiCaprio in.🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️",

      "Not 2025 propaganda AT ALL \n😆🖕",
      "I'd stay away from this movie.",
      "This is a poorly adapted movie from a novel. Propaganda seriously, added a lot of little things not in the book. Most people who like the movie can't even understand the subtle tone of the movie.",
      "I just watched it all I gotta say is. Viva la revolution lmao. Good movie and funny",
      "I'm a whiite heterosexuall man and I did not want to subject the actors to my Oppresssive Whiite Male Gaze.  So I stayed away from the theater again.  Aren't I a good ally?  I thank me for my service.\nMy money stayed in my pocket, they weren't subjected to my systemic structural capitalist whiteness, everyone walked away happy.",
      "This movie will soon become a documentary 😢",
      "Just saw this and really is a brilliant film. Have to wonder what is up with Rotten Tomatoes though, it seems like a whole lot of MAGA people or bots are bombing it simply because it is told from the viewpoint of some radical lefties?\nIt really is pathetic how toxic and partisan the American political landscape has become, it's childish really. Obviously I don't expect everyone to love the same movies as me, some films won't land with people. But there are just way too many one star reviews of this film on there for it to be a coincidence.\n\nAnyway rant over, I recommend this film, it's a wild ride.",
      "Except the casting this movie is a disaster. So are the critics - shallow approach. If you look in the past and see what other movies were declared \"masterpieces\" you'll begin to laugh. This director NEVER made a decent movie before, but the critics believe he had an epiphany or smth:)). Tarkowski were are you",
      "I like the scene where the shifty jewess gets smoked in the convenience store.",
      "This propaganda flick will certainly appeal to and inspire useful idiots needed by the leftwing radicals and Frankfurt School Marxists.",
      "I'm sorry but I do not get with all the hubbub is about. This movie is absolutely horrible with a capital h! I can't believe it won any awards. So cheesy and just plain stupid. I'm guessing there weren't very many movies to choose from to pass out Awards to because this one sucked",
      "This film justifies those who destroy in the name of \"justice.\" It encourages troubled souls to take the law into their own hands, resulting in the kind of tragedy we saw in Minneapolis this week. And because the Devil must absolutely LOVE this film, it will likely continue to get big awards, including probably sweeping the Academy Awards. Films once helped bring the best out of us. Now they encourage the WORST. Thanks, Hollywood!",

      "2nd oscar for leo",
      "Greatest film of this decade so far. Even the small moments like the skaters on the roofs and Leo being unable to get to his people because of passwords. It's just awesome and relevant. What made it was that I felt both sympathy for Penn and Leo at the end. Bad old guys always win.",
      "Not for me",
      "Same ol’ scenario: white people are evil, and are part of a secret cabal to destroy other races. Great movie, but I’m tired of being portrayed as the enemy, and of being guilty of being white.",

From hearing what the director said, he wrote it 20 years ago and has been trying to get it made for awhile and part of why it doesn't land is because of our current societal situation outpacing the time it was written in",

But they know how to repair after seeing us work on the matter a few time. \n\nThen that location was stable and really nice. Ok, so then I get abducted from there. And i was  happy. \n\n\nSo I want to remind the time when I was going to go to full time academy in elementary school and dad said its a nice place and mom was like I can't live without her here so I had to leave there and it was wonderful. Then different people showed up and it was safe but weird and creepy very up to something kids there and no one else. We've done this a few times and I think we went on a field trip and then I recall being at home on the other side of the country, then back at the full time academy by like black van. Im not kidding. Normal was sooooo close. \n\n\nI see a lot of dynamics of Hebrew status and isreali status of the people in the movie. I also see dynamics where we split up matters that seem to be a matter in a reasonably seceret way to keep things stable.",
