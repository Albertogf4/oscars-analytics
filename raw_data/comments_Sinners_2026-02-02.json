      "really good film and the music is brilliant",
      "Wunmi Mosaku was certainly a joy to watch leading lady Character awesome",
      "Fking boring",
      "Full of racism against white people complete trash, worst vampire movie ever made",
      "I just saw Sinners today.  To be honest, how could this movie nominated for 16 Oscars.  It is very ridiculous.  Nowadays Oscar committee is a joke for me.  It is all politically-related.  Movies from South Korea, Taiwan, Japan always nominated.  In my point of view, most of movies from Hollywood for more than 2 decades were poorly made in opposite to its huge budget.  If you are a huge movie-goer, I dare all of you to see Chinese movie called Hero (2002) starring Jet Li, Tony Leung, Donni Yen, Maggie Cheung and directed by Yimou Zhang  This movie has been the BEST movie of all time for me.  The BEST movie ever made so far.  It is so DAWN good.  If you know how the movie is all about.  Hey, don't get me wrong.  I am not Chinese.",
      "I seriously believe that the only reason this movie won awards at the academies, is because of \"White Guilt\" seriously.....when has a Vampire Action movie ever won any awards? and it's not like the performances were like amazing or anything either.....",
      "Absolutely incredible.",
      "blade from wish",
      "Just watched this last night. Great movie. I totally understand the 16 Oscar nominations.",
      "White people are officially the blood drinking devils they always have been. This movie is a perfect representation of whom whites really are.",
      "Ugh",
      "Remember the days where it took over 20 years for Steven Spielberg to win his first Oscar",
      "Nice movie,  and it deserves an oscar for the musical score. \nSuper overrated tho. But i do get it. This is what Hollywood is about now, so anything feeding their narrative will do great things.",
      "White man = bad",
      "Best vampire movie I've ever seen 🤎",
      "This movie needs a prequel of Remmick",
      "The world, Americans aren't you tired of these kind of movies???!!! \n\nJoin the real cinema! One day the world will wake up, Hollywood particularly.",

      "Late to the party but my husband and I just finished watching this movie. 2 mins into the movie my husband tells me “this movie is about the blues music by just looking at the neck of the guitar his holding. This movies is going to be spiritual and there’s going to be a lot of symbolism” and over 2 hrs later he was right. He grew up  heavily involved in church….",
      "I have a feeling that all of these comments are from bots or blind people.",

To glorify drinking , whoredom, adultery , smoking , witchcraft , and to portray the black Christian church as evil is a huge attack on the black community and the truth which is the Bible !",
      "After saw 16 Oscar nominations I saw it on Prime Video and cannot believe this got such raves. The idea of happy singing vampires with bloody mouths is bizarre and I got no emotional pull from any of the characters.",
      "THIS MOVIE IS NOT EVEN WORTHY TO GET A NOMINATION ! GOOD ACTING FROM ALL BUT NOT WORTH ALL THIS HYPE !  INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE WAS A MASTERPIECE , THIS FILM IS  JUST GENERIC VAMPIRE MOVIE  .... THE MUSIC IN THE FILM IS AMAZING !",

      "It is just an ordinary movie but I dont feel anything it deserve oscar awards where there is more best movies out there. Oscar is worst.",

      "Another crappy movie blaming the Whites for the lack of progression in the Black Community, where is the Movie Thanking White Entrepreneur's for creating the ultimate in comfort, travel efficiency, income, food assistance, music production, homesteads, civil rights and employment opportunities. Have you seen what's going on in Africa lately ?????, even though your gratitude remains hidden = YOUR WELCOME",

      "The only thing holding Marvel back from making more Blade movies is vampires and racism.",
      "Oh my Lort!! 😮 Lemee tell ya something. I don't watch too many new(ish) movies. They don't interest me much. I heard a vague reference to this movie by Coffee with Carlos on The Stephanie Miller Show, searched it and was surprised ot was on the HBO/MAX app. Well, from the story, to the visuals, and music 🎶 I  absolutely LOVED this movie and I don't like much of anything anymore. I  guess I got a little Anhedonia going on, okay, a lot 🤷🏼so being in it, I'm fully aware when something comes along this rare that takes me out of the here an now, and allows some desperately needed escapism. This movie is so good for so many reasons on so many different levels. Beautifully shot. It's a winner all around.👍🏻😳",

      "Good movie",
      "I thought this film was excellent in almost every way........except for the introduction of vampires, which is not an interesting concept to me in the slightest. If the makers had swapped that for some other supernatural element - demonic spirits or something - it would have carried all the way through.",

I grew up with English and speak three languages reasonably well but the lingo here was as hard to follow as deep south Bavarian, Cockney, a Scottish brogue or Newfie English. If the southern accents are authentic, that's perhaps as it should be, but I found this movie unwatchable.  It might be worth another attempt when a subtitled version becomes available.",

But the whole movie, script using history, directors, producers, actors, photography and all behind the scenes support, shows its a labor of love making a great movie. Hope it gets rereleased in a Dolby (special speakers for surround sound), even better would be Dolby IMAX. And yes the dance concert scene showing the brief history of humans with music should be part of every school's music curriculum.",

Now, I don't know if it was like this at the theatres, but on Prime, it seemed very muffled and unorganized. The scenes were loosely connected, and the back stories didn't really do much for the narrative. I like Michael B Jordan, but this wasn't his best effort. The story of vampires is a subject that's difficult to tie to the early 1920s time period. His attempt was a valiant effort indeed. I give it 2 1/2 out of 5. It's still a good movie to lose yourself in, if only for 125 minutes.",

Why did they seem to want to downplay it like they did? Especially from a director who has several hugely successful movies on his resume. That doesn't happen with other directors.

It was more than just beautiful choreography; it was a powerful visual journey through Black history and culture. From traditional African rhythms to modern-day movements like hip-hop and twerking, every step told a story of resilience, evolution, and identity.\n\nIt captured the spirit of generations in just a few minutes, and I honestly haven’t stopped thinking about it. That scene alone makes the entire film unforgettable.",
