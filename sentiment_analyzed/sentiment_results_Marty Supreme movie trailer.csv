No!  The lead character is human trash.  He's an immoral manipulator that cons people NONSTOP to get what he wants.  If you're interested in watching this for some kind of inspiration, in a Rocky type way, this isn't the film for you.  Is it technically good  with excellent acting/directing and entertaining soundtrack, yes.  

Because I was expecting a more typicall ""inspirational"" film, i was shocked that this isn't that.  I personally don't want to spend 2 hours watching an immoral hustler overcoming non stop nightmare type scenarios that he puts himself in due to his dumb choices.  I guess one redeeming quality of the film is that, in the script, the lead character has non stop problems and in the end, his outcome is far from ideal, so they don't glamorize deception.",0.127,0.691,0.182,0.9145,Positive

Went to see it out of boredom and was pleasantly surprised. Yes he is an a- h0le however it reflects reality - the go better ruthless attitude of many at the top ... Whilst he isn't a good person and possesses the worst moral traits, his ambition and confidence is inspirational .. believing in yourself that much that you won't take nothing but success ... I read on another review that the chaotic chain of events gave some people anxiety ... Welcome to my life lol. Didn't give me anxiety at all .. just felt like everyday to me, where things can go wrong and not everything is always in your control ... But life goes on. I guess you could say that the movie is about determination. Also a harsh reminder that yes sometimes bad people in life do make it in life ... But what do you chose .. I rather sleep at night than chose wrong over right. Take from it what you will. But honestly I think it was a good movie and I was kept fully engaged without getting bored.

The female characters aren’t written as full people, they’re basically there to be desired, used, or to push the male lead’s story forward. Everything about them is framed through a male gaze, like they’re pawns or prizes rather than subjects with agency.

What bothered me most is that the film doesn’t even question this dynamic. It just repeats the same tired, male-dominated storytelling and acts like that’s edgy or meaningful. Even pregnancy is handled in a weirdly objectifying way, turning the female body into another aesthetic or narrative device instead of something human or complex.

It’s not challenging film conventions at all, it’s reinforcing them. For a movie that seems to think it’s saying something bold, it actually feels pretty shallow and outdated.",0.06,0.797,0.143,0.9073,Positive

The female characters aren’t written as full people, they’re basically there to be desired, used, or to push the male lead’s story forward. Everything about them is framed through a male gaze, like they’re pawns or prizes rather than subjects with agency.

What bothered me most is that the film doesn’t even question this dynamic. It just repeats the same tired, male-dominated storytelling and acts like that’s edgy or meaningful. Even pregnancy is handled in a weirdly objectifying way, turning the female body into another aesthetic or narrative device instead of something human or complex.

It’s not challenging film conventions at all, it’s reinforcing them. For a movie that seems to think it’s saying something bold, it actually feels pretty shallow and outdated.",0.06,0.797,0.143,0.9073,Positive
