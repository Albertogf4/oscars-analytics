I don't have anything to say which meant it worked in its own right...except when it started to lag. The last hour needed an edit to keep the whole thing snappy like the start. A little dark, but their personal strength and vision were united. I really enjoyed some of these characters, even deCaprio, and I never like deCaprio. The 'regular' kids were awesome in their clips. The film could have had more of that, how the 3rd parties reacted. In film the best moments are others' reactions, like when the dolphins breached in the Big Blue. The high school kids' non-acting acting was a thing of beauty. Juxtaposing that with Sean Penn's gross character which was just over the top weird.

Soooooooo, I remember the time we had the equipment and moved it and it was stable and we held it at location and it worked correctly but I forgot what we were supposed to be doing. But they know how to repair after seeing us work on the matter a few time. 

Then that location was stable and really nice. Ok, so then I get abducted from there. And i was  happy. 


So I want to remind the time when I was going to go to full time academy in elementary school and dad said its a nice place and mom was like I can't live without her here so I had to leave there and it was wonderful. Then different people showed up and it was safe but weird and creepy very up to something kids there and no one else. We've done this a few times and I think we went on a field trip and then I recall being at home on the other side of the country, then back at the full time academy by like black van. Im not kidding. Normal was sooooo close. 


I see a lot of dynamics of Hebrew status and isreali status of the people in the movie. I also see dynamics where we split up matters that seem to be a matter in a reasonably seceret way to keep things stable.",0.041,0.792,0.167,0.9871,Positive

I’ve seen the movie  3 times in 70mm IMAX and am going again in 2 days for the re- release. The highway chase at the end is worth the price of admission alone. The cinematography – the action choreography and the music make it an incredible IMAX experience.  this trailer reminds me of how incredible, funny, shocking and inventive the dialogue in the script is as well. Hopefully only those of us who have seen the movie will see this  because we think of spoilers as plot points, but this trailer does spoil a lot of the best dialogue moments.",0.028,0.821,0.151,0.9254,Positive

Digital streaming and greed has changed studios to a point where they don't care enough about story and indie movies such as Salya The First AGI and A History of Future of Future  have better stories than most of the movies with dozens of millions of dollars budget!
