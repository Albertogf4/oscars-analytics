      "Felt bored watching this movie in theatre. Anyone else feel that way?",
      "Yall I watched it, and this movie is basically about a poor, horny, narcissist who manipulates his way to beating the #1 table tennis champion. It’s not really worth the watch. In my opinion, a microbiology documentary would’ve been more interesting. 😂",
      "Such an aggressive marketing campaign for a movie that we’re all going to forget the second it’s released.",
      "Every person at their right frequency can be at their element. The thing we dispise is ultimately our greatest boss",

      "What an absolute joke and waste of $10.  I can't believe this \"movie\" made it to the screen.  0- star rating.  I should have walked out after the first 5 minutes.",

      "It’s the best film I’ve ever seen.",
      "The love for this dude is so forced; it's like the whole of America is trying to push Timothy in our faces, like in everything, to make him this big star, when in reality, he is really not that great or interesting. He is really blunt as a person, and he's simply just like any other young actor on television. It's 'them' who are making him more than what he actually is. 'Them' in like, idk, Hollywood or whoever runs this shit.",

      "Why the intro is the same that The Mask 2",
      "WACK AND WOKE",

      "EVERYBODYYYYYY WANTS TO RULE THE WOOOOOOORLD",
      "No wonder they started a trend where esdeekid is timothee for no reason. All was a media publicity smh",
      "there's a trend in hollywood in the past 10 years that only allows oral sex scenes when it's the man performing on a woman. Nothing against it, but it's weird that all the movies now only have that way and not the other way around (or both ways!). Very weird... It's like it's programmed...",

      "🎬🎬 BEST ACTOR | And the Oscar goes to... Timothée Chalamet. Impossível ele não ganhar o Oscar de Melhor Ator este ano. Uma interpretação simplesmente visceral no filme \"Marty Supreme\". Chalamet se jogou de corpo e alma nesse filme. Performance arrebatadora. O ator entrega a melhor atuação da carreira no ótimo ‘Marty Supreme’. Não vai ter pra ninguém. Filme para ser visto na telona do cinema. Trilha sonora digna de Oscar. Abrindo o filme a linda música \"Forever Young\" (Alphaville).",
      "Saw it today ..... frenetic at best . They threw everything at it and it still didnt hit where it should have. Good acting Id say but not oscar worthy in my humble opinion. Not something id see again.",

      "obra maestra. La acabo de ver e iré a verla nuevamente. Lo que hace el actor es sublime en toda la película. El guión es arrasador no te deja respiro tiene un ritmo que hace que te subas desde el primer instante.\nNo es un ritmo acelerado artificial.. tiene el pulso de la ambición del protagonista que te contagia. La actuación de este muchacho es emocionante me hizo acordar al Robert De Niro de \" Malas calles\" o al de \" Taxi driver\" o \" New York New York\" lleno de vena y energía. También tiene esa chispa del Pacino joven de \" Serpico\" y de \" Tarde de perros\" o al Gene Hackman de \" Contacto en Francia\" una actuación verdadera con sangre en las venas que remite a esos actores de los Setenta",

      "Yea no",
      "this trailer is SO fcking misleading, holy shit",
      "Heres the deal on this film....It's NOT an inspiration Rocky type character, that's basically a really good man that has to remain determined to achieve his dreams. No!  The lead character is human trash.  He's an immoral manipulator that cons people NONSTOP to get what he wants.  If you're interested in watching this for some kind of inspiration, in a Rocky type way, this isn't the film for you.  Is it technically good  with excellent acting/directing and entertaining soundtrack, yes.  \n\nBecause I was expecting a more typicall \"inspirational\" film, i was shocked that this isn't that.  I personally don't want to spend 2 hours watching an immoral hustler overcoming non stop nightmare type scenarios that he puts himself in due to his dumb choices.  I guess one redeeming quality of the film is that, in the script, the lead character has non stop problems and in the end, his outcome is far from ideal, so they don't glamorize deception.",

Aside from the anachronistic soundtrack, all else was really enjoyable. Finally a decent movie that's not all CGI.",
      "one of the worse movies i ever watched in the theatre",
      "Perhaps this detail won't matter to everyone, but seeing Abel Ferrara act in an independent film, even one from A24, after such a long absence from cinema in a specific area due to his controversial style, is a real pleasure to see him here in this movie. Thank you, Josh Safdie and A24."

Direction was nothing short of BRILLIANT.!!!\nCasting was pure perfection..!     Having   KOTO KAWAGUCHI   in this film gave it credibility and authenticity..!\nAnd genius to have Kevin O'Leary playing Rockwell.  Would love to know the cheque he wrote to production-\nbut this is how much of Hollywood works.     BUT.....  he came through with flying colours..!!!   He was ''wonderful'' 😂\nThe lead actor T.C will be nominated and win his first Oscar because he blew away the competition.

Yes he is an a- h0le however it reflects reality - the go better ruthless attitude of many at the top ... Whilst he isn't a good person and possesses the worst moral traits, his ambition and confidence is inspirational .. believing in yourself that much that you won't take nothing but success ... I read on another review that the chaotic chain of events gave some people anxiety ... Welcome to my life lol. Didn't give me anxiety at all .. just felt like everyday to me, where things can go wrong and not everything is always in your control ... But life goes on. I guess you could say that the movie is about determination. Also a harsh reminder that yes sometimes bad people in life do make it in life ... But what do you chose .. I rather sleep at night than chose wrong over right. Take from it what you will. But honestly I think it was a good movie and I was kept fully engaged without getting bored. Watch it",

And I feel like I’m losing my mind. I think people just want him to be more than he actually is. We have such a lack truly truly talented young performers now that people just fabricate this shit, well that and the PR teams do a fine job at selling you that. I mean maybe he’ll prove me wrong and he’ll be what people said in this movie, but I highly doubt it. I hear shit like that with every Chalamet performance, and yet, it’s always mid lol",

      "This is certainly one of the best advertising campaigns of the year, if not the decade, and I hope all the marketers and the A24 team get a Christmas bonus, and the film itself grosses at least $200 million. It's interesting, though, that they edited it like a mix of a rap video and a gangster film, with practically no ping-pong. It's practically all mani-shots! (Sea lion!!)",

      "Es buena la película, buenas actuaciones, pero tiene un ritmo de diálogo frenético, poca pausa y superposición de diálogos que a veces abruma. Debería haber sido un poco mas pausada.",
      "Pelicula sin valores, nada recomendable,  violencia  , sin ninguna  buena enseñansa para los hijos       puro inrespeto",
      "Qué pedazo de trailer.",
      "GRAN actuación de Timothée Chalamet, también me gustaron las de Gwyneth Paltrow, Odessa A'zion, Kevin O'Leary, Tyler, the Creator y Abel Ferrara. Lo único que le resta a la película es la banda sonora, debía ser acorde a la época que se mostraba.",
