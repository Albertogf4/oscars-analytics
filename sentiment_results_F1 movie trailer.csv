When I first saw the advertisements for the F1 movie I knew I had to watch it. I personally am not t...,"When I first saw the advertisements for the F1 movie I knew I had to watch it. I personally am not too into the sport, but the immersive visuals hooked me. At the start, you are introduced to Sonny Hayes, a man whose career almost ended in a brutal crash. Throughout the entire movie, this crash seems to be haunting him, even being the reason as to why he left the sport in the first place. He’s portrayed by Brad Pitt, who I know mostly for his roles as David Mills on Se7en and Tyler Durden on Fight Club. A couple months before I saw the F1 movie, I saw Se7en so I already had high expectations for the F1 movie. Anyway, he goes on to win the 24 Hours of Daytona and meets with his former teammate and close friend, Ruben Cervantes. His friend recruits him into his currently failing team known as APXGP, where he meets Joshua Pearce, a young rising star in the F1 scene. Pearce is played by Damson Idris, a person widely known for their role as Franklin Saint on Snowfall. Throughout the entire story, these two are our main characters. 
	Sonny Hayes' whole role in the entire movie is to be a mentor for Pearce. And that’s exactly what he does. One thing that I loved about Sonny was his calmness compared to Joshua. While Joshua is kind of like a hot head, Hayes keeps his cool in almost every situation. They are essentially the opposites of each other. Also, the evolution of their relationship is something that I thought was great. They begin with having a sort of rivalry and high egos; though, most of this is just Joshua. Thus, as the story progresses more, Joshua starts to kind of understand Hayes and they both create a mutual respect for each other and think of the team first rather than their own selves. In the end, one of the main points of the movie is their bond and how it grows.
	Moving on from the characters, the movie’s visuals are stunning. The movie shows the competitiveness within F1 and helps viewers understand what truly happens on the track. One thing I was surprised to find out about this was that some scenes were actually shot during the Grand-Prix’s. Also, the movie shows realistic racing, but this was something I expected since Lewis Hamilton was one of the producers of the movie. In my opinion, this is something that fits both casual movie watchers, and fans of F1. 
In conclusion, I think this is something that is worth watching. The characters are great, and so are the visuals. I can’t say much except to just tell you to watch it. It’s a great movie which can leave you with an interest in F1. There are many great things about this movie that I didn’t mention like the importance of Haye’s deck of cards. It’s a movie that will have you wondering about the next adventure of Hayes.",0.043,0.801,0.156,0.997,Positive

"Not being a particular Formula 1 fan, I didn't focus on the aesthetic boldness of director Joseph Ko...","Not being a particular Formula 1 fan, I didn't focus on the aesthetic boldness of director Joseph Kosinski. So I set aside any comparisons with the harsh realities of this world.
And I'm glad I did, because I loved this blockbuster. Admittedly, the storyline is somewhat farcical, with the sixty-year-old man called in to save a team in total decline. It's a bit like Jackie Stewart, having become a team manager, calling Jacky Ickx back in 2000 to do battle with Schumacher and Häkkinen.
But it's cinema, so it doesn't matter, right? Especially since the racing scenes are impressive. I didn't notice the time passing, and the film still lasts 2 hours and 35 minutes. And then there's the music by Hans Zimmer, of course.
I honestly had a good laugh. Javier Bardem is exquisite as usual, Damson Idris has a beautiful smile, little Kerry Condon is delicious as can be and Brad Pitt is still as cool as ever... ""Who said anything about safe ?"" 😉",0.025,0.721,0.254,0.9937,Positive

_As an F1 movie, seen from a diehard fan, its a complete mess._ It ignores a lot of the rules and regulations of the sport.

_But as a movie produced by Lewis Hamilton himself, targeted to general audiences, _*_ITS GREAT._*

It ignores the rulebook for the sake of action, it has great shots, a really flawless teamwork to make the races as intense as they can be, and the fact that the real F1 presenters are involved, makes a better inmersion overall.

9/10. I went with a friend who knew nothing about F1, and now has real interest on the sport.",0.042,0.716,0.242,0.9852,Positive

But even worse than that, the writing, the script... it's so awful. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I've seen a ton of praise of it. This trailer does not make me excited to see it. It doesn't matter how fantastic the visuals are, if the writing is garbage it's kinda pointless.",0.231,0.648,0.122,-0.872,Negative
